Here is one of my favourite insight stories.
In his last years of life, before he had a stroke and couldn’t speak any more, Ajahn Chah was getting sick. We Western monks studied the Vinaya and discovered one thing that wasn’t well known in Thailand. In the time of the Buddha, the monks had saunas. So, we decided to build one for Ajahn Chah to help him keep healthy.
Another reason for building a sauna was that we then had an excuse to invite Ajahn Chah to visit Wat Pah Nanachat to give us a weekly talk. Wat Nanachat was the monastery where the Western monks were staying.
Usually when he came over, I’d listen to his talk and then go and help him take his sauna. However, one particular week, he gave a brilliant talk. It went right inside of me, and I started blissing out while listening to the Dhamma. Because there were enough monks to look after Ajahn Chah, I went to the back of the hall, sat down on the concrete, and meditated deeply for two hours. When I came out, I was really happy. I then wondered whether there was still time to help my teacher. I started walking towards the sauna but realised I was too late. Ajahn Chah was already coming along the path, heading towards the car that would take him back to his monastery, Wat Pah Pong.
Ajahn Chah walked towards me, looking me right in the eye as we approached one another. I could feel Ajahn Chah reading my mind. Often I’d be embarrassed, but at that moment I’d just come out of a very deep meditation, and for once, I was happy he was reading my mind.
He looked at me firmly. He then asked, fiercely and sharply, “Brahmavamso! Why?” 
I paused. “I don’t know,” was all I could say.
Whenever we Western monks said something stupid like that, it’s amazing that these great monks would just laugh their head off. They thought it was so funny. People with all these big degrees from the West were so idiotic.
Ajahn Chah screwed up his face and said, “I’ll tell you the answer.” He had seen that my hindrances were gone for a while, and he wanted to see if he could enlighten one of his disciples.
“If anybody asks you the question ‘Why?’, the answer is, ‘There’s nothing.’” He paused, then asked, “Do you understand?”
“Yes,” I replied.
“No, you don’t,” he responded, and walked away.
It was a wonderful experience, even though I didn’t understand it at the time. Deep Dhamma takes a long time to penetrate.
