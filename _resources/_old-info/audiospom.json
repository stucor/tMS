        "Serenity and insight are the two great wings of Buddhist meditation. They each have a special role to play in the path to Awakening. While some modern approaches seek to marginalize serenity in favor of dry insight, the Buddha’s own discourses place serenity right at the heart of the path. This book collects virtually all the significant passages on this topic that are found in the early discourses, carefully explained for the modern reader.",
        "Bhikkhu Sujato is a Buddhist monk. Since receiving full ordination in 1994 he has lived in forest monasteries and hermitages developing meditation and studying the Buddha’s teachings. In 2003 he established Santi Forest Monastery near Sydney, Australia."
