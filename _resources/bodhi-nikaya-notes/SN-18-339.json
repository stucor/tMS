    "Quote": "<p>To the four primary elements of the form aggregate (<em>cattāro mahābhūtā</em>) the suttas sometimes add the space element (<em>ākāsadhātu</em>)—which (according to the commentaries) represents derived form (<em>upādāya rūpa</em>)—and the consciousness element (<em>viññāṇadhātu</em>), which represents the entire mental side of existence. For a detailed analysis of all six elements, see MN III 240,17-243,10.</p>"
