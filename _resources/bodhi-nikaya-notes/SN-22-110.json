    "Quote": "<p><em>Ruppatī ti kho bhikkhave tasmā rūpan ti vuccati</em>. I have tried, though clumsily, to capture the subtle word play of the Pāli, which capitalizes on the apparent correspondence between the verb <em>ruppati</em> and the noun <em>rūpa</em>. Etymologically, the two are not related. <em>Ruppati</em> is a passive verb from the root <em>rup</em> (= Skt <em>lup</em>), “to break, injure, spoil.” MW lists <em>rupyate</em> (s.v. <em>rup</em>), “to suffer violent or racking pain.” See too PED, s.v. <em>ruppati</em>. Spk glosses: <em>Ruppatī ti kuppati ghaṭṭīyati pīḷīyati, bhijjatī ti attho</em>; “<em>It is deformed</em>: it is disturbed, stricken, oppressed, meaning ‘it is broken.’”</p><p>At KS 2:73, n. 1, Woodward has misunderstood the point of the commentary. It is not the case that Buddhaghosa misconstrues “these various contacts not as referring to this life, but as ‘informing’ creatures in other spheres.” Rather, he merely cites the cold hells, hot hells, etc., as the realms where the different types of “deformation” are most evident (<em>pākaṭa</em>). Spk adds that being “deformed” is the specific characteristic (<em>paccattalakkhaṇa</em>) of form, which distinguishes it from feeling and the other aggregates; but the general characteristics (<em>sāmaññalakkhaṇa</em>) are what they have in common, namely, impermanence, suffering, and nonself.</p>"
