    "Quote": "<p><em>Caraṇaṃ nāma cittaṃ</em>. <em>Citta</em> here is the equivalent of Skt <em>citra</em>, picture. The exact meaning of the picture’s title is obscure. Spk glosses <em>vicaraṇacitta</em>, “the wandering picture” [Spk-pṭ: because they take it and wander about with it], but <em>caraṇa</em> here possibly means conduct, as in other contexts.</p><p>Spk: The Saṅkha were a sect of heretical brahmins. Having taken a canvas, they had various pictures painted on it of the good and bad destinations to illustrate success and failure, and then they took it around on their wanderings. They would show it to the people, explaining, “If one does this deed, one gets this result; if one does that, one gets that.”</p>"
