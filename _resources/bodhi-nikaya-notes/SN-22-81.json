    "Quote": "<p>Strangely, the Nikāyas do not offer an analysis of the form derived from the four great elements (<em>catunnaṃ mahābhūtānaṃ upādāya rūpaṃ</em>). This analysis first appears only in the Abhidhamma Piṭaka, according to which such form includes the five sense faculties, four sense objects (the tactile object being assigned to three of the great elements, excluding the water element), the space element, sexual determination, physical nutriment (= edible food), etc.; see CMA 6:2-5. On nutriment as a condition for the physical body, see&nbsp;<strong>II, n. 18</strong>. In this sutta the proximate condition for the origination of each of the five aggregates is shown, in contrast with&nbsp;<strong>22:5</strong>, which shows the collective distal or remote condition for all five aggregates. For the distinction of the two types of conditions, see&nbsp;<strong>II, n. 58</strong>.</p>"
