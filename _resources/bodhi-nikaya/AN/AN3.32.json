    "Quote": "<p>Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p><p>“Bhante, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this conscious body; (2) he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and (3) he would enter and dwell in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it?”</p><p>“He could, Ānanda.”</p><p>“But how, Bhante, could he obtain such a state of concentration?”</p><p>“Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu thinks thus: ‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna.’ In this way, Ānanda, a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this conscious body; he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and he would enter and dwell in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it. And it was with reference to this that I said in the Pārāyana, in ‘The Questions of Puṇṇaka’:</p><blockquote><p>“Having comprehended the highs and lows in the world,<br />he is not perturbed by anything in the world.<br />Peaceful, fumeless, untroubled, wishless,<br />he has, I say, crossed over birth and old age.”</p></blockquote>"
