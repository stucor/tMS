The PTS version would thus seem to have only two aṅgas, whose explanation the disciple wants from the Tathāgata (cp. the translation by Horner: ‘…for the sake of an exposition of the discourses that are in prose and in prose and verse’). But the grammar is odd; this phrase would seem rather to have formed by contraction from the Burmese/Sinhalese reading (= <em>suttaṁ geyyaṁ veyyākaraṇ’ assa hetu</em>). The Chinese version reads 正經．歌詠．記說故. This does indicate that its original read <em>hetuḥ</em>, not <em>sotuṁ</em> as proposed by the Siamese edition. <em>Sotuṁ</em> (‘for the hearing of…’) is more straightforward; grammatically the compound formation in the Siamese edition is also more straightforward, leading me to suspect the Thai editors have normalized a difficult reading. The Chinese does not give a hint to the grammatical problems of this passage. In any case, the Chinese and most of the Pali versions have three aṅgas, and the apparent presence of two aṅgas in the PTS seems easily explicable.</p>"
