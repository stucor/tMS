        "The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta is the most influential scripture in Buddhist meditaion. It is the foundation text for the modern schools of ‘vipassanā’ or ‘insight’ meditation. The well-known Pali discourse is, however, only one of many early Buddhist texts that deal with mindfulness. This is the first full-scale study to encompass all extant versions of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, taking into account the dynamic evolution of the Buddhist scriptures and the broader Indian meditative culture. A new vision emerges from this groundbreaking study: mindfulness is not a system of ‘dry insight’ but is the ‘way to convergence’ leading the mind to deep states of peace.",
        "Bhikkhu Sujato is a Buddhist monk. Since taking higher ordination in Thailand in 1994 he has lived in monasteries and hermitages devloping meditation and studying the Buddha’s teachings. In 2003 he established Santi Forest Monastery near Sydney, Australia."
