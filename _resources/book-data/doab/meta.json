			"ShortAbstract" : "<p>In this essay Ajahn Brahm discusses the meaning of the twelve factors that make up the standard description of dependent origination. He analyses the nature of the causes linking each pair of neighbouring factors, using a Western model of causality. Having explained what the Buddha meant by dependent origination, he then examines perhaps the most interesting question: Why did the Buddha place such importance on dependent origination? What is its purpose? In the final section, Ajahn proposes that the function of dependent origination is threefold:<br>1) To explain how there can be rebirth without a soul.<br>2) To answer the question “What is life?”<br>3) To understand why there is suffering, and where suffering comes to an end.</p>",
