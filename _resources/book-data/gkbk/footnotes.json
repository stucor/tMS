It is interesting that Christmas Humphreys and Nāgasena were closer to Martin Luther’s conception of God than they were to the Buddha’s teaching of kamma. According to Luther: “The small lack of peace called war or the sword must set a limit to this universal, worldwide lack of peace which would destroy everyone. This is why God honours the sword so highly that he says that he himself has instituted it (Rom.13:1) and does not want men to say or think that they have invented it or instituted it. For the hand that wields this sword and kills with it is not man’s hand, but God’s; and it is not man, but God, who hangs, tortures, beheads, kills, and fights. All these are God’s works and judgments.” <span class='sesame' data-sesame-key='zotref:LutherM 1526a'>Luther 1526</span>.</p>"
