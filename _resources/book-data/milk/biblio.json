  {"id":"DrogeTabor 1992a","abstract":"The right to die with dignity has emerged as a crucial issue in the 1990s. As reports of family- or doctor-assisted suicides increase, the issue of voluntary death is occupying an increasingly prominent place in our national consciousness. From theologians, medical ethicists, and talk-show hosts to people facing the issue in their own lives, all are participants in the debate, each seeking to influence and control the discourse on suicide and euthanasia. Now, this pathbreaking study provides a stunning reappraisal of the early history of this controversial human freedom. A Noble Death challenges the often unquestioning attitudes we have toward suicide and traces the evolution of these attitudes from the time of Socrates to the present day. Droge and Tabor reveal the extraordinary fact that early Christians and Jews did not absolutely condemn suicide, but instead focused on whether or not it was committed for noble reasons. In fascinating detail, the texts and traditions presented here--from Greek and Roman philosophy, to Judaism, Christianity, and the Bible itself--make clear that the decision to take one's life, or allow it to be taken, was not considered a sin but a noble choice, provided there was sufficient justification for the act. \"The Bible nowhere proscribes suicide\", the authors write. \"In fact, there are at least seven individuals in the Bible who take their own lives, and none of them is condemned for the act.... Many (have) a vague notion that the so-called Judeo-Christian tradition speaks decisively against the act of suicide, but just what that objection is, when it developed, and what came before it, are mostly not known\". From Socrates' insistence on the requirement ofa divine sign to Seneca's emphasis on the unqualified freedom of the individual to Augustine's attempt to restrict that freedom, A Noble Death illustrates how strongly we share these early attitudes toward voluntary death. But the very attempt to find a consensus indicates how the decision to die could--and can--be a conscientious one. Intensely relevant to the contemporary debate, A Noble Death takes the reader on a challenging and instructive journey to the surprising origins of Western culture's thoughts on voluntary death.","author":[{"family":"Droge","given":"Arthur J."},{"family":"Tabor","given":"James D."}],"citation-key":"DrogeTabor 1992a","file":"","ISBN":"978-0-06-062095-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"language":"en","note":"IACode: nobledeathsuicid00drog","number-of-pages":"234","publisher":"HarperSanFrancisco","title":"A Noble Death: Suicide and Martyrdom Among Christians and Jews in Antiquity","title-short":"A Noble Death","type":"book"},

Erich Fromm, the renowned psychoanalyst, sees love as the ultimate need and desire of all human beings. In this book, he discusses every aspect of the subject: romantic love, the love of parents for children, brotherly love, erotic love, self-love and the love of God or the divine. He looks at the theory of love as it appears throughout the cultures of the world and at the practice, how we show or fail to show love to one another. Love is an art, which we need to develop and practice in order to find true commitment. We need to find it, individually and as a society as a whole. Erich Fromm is one of the major figures in the field of psychoanalysis. He devoted himself to consultant psychology and theoretical investigation for many years.

The various teachings of the Buddha, found throughout the Pali Canon, are organized in a clear, comprehensive manner. In the course of his treatise Buddhaghosa gives full and detailed instructions on the forty subjects of meditation aimed at concentration, an elaborate account of the Buddhist Abhidhamma philosophy, and explicit descriptions of the stages of insight culminating in final liberation.The author, Bhadantacaryia Buddhaghosa, composed the Visuddhimagga in the early part of the 5th century A.D. The India-born monk-scholar traveled to Sri Lanka to translate into Pali the extensive Sinhalese commentaries preserved there. His crystallization of the entire Pali Canon reinvigorated Theravada Buddhism in India and Sri Lanka. It still shines as clearly today, in this brilliant 1956 translation by the British-born monk, Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli, that in itself is considered an outstanding achievement of Pali scholarship of the 20th century.This book is from BPS Pariyatti Editions, which co-publishes classic and contemporary titles from the Buddhist Publication Society of Kandy, Sri Lanka.","citation-key":"Ñanamoli 1956a","collection-number":"207H","collection-title":"Book Publications","contributor":[{"family":"Ñanamoli","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"file":"1956_The Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga) by Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["1956"]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Buddhist Publication Society","title":"The Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga) by Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa","type":"book","URL":"https://www.bps.lk/library-search-select.php?id=bp207h"},

  {"id":"Ohnuma 2008a","abstract":"This is the first comprehensive study of a central narrative theme in premodern South Asian Buddhist literature: the Buddha's bodily self- sacrifice during his previous lives as a bodhisattva. Conducting close readings of stories from Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, and Tibetan literature written between the third century B.c.e. and the late medieval period, Reiko Ohnuma argues that this theme has had a major impact on the development of Buddhist philosophy and culture. Whether he takes the form of king, prince, ascetic, elephant, hare, serpent, or god, the bodhisattva repeatedly gives his body or parts of his flesh to others. He leaps into fires, drowns himself in the ocean, rips out his tusks, gouges out his eyes, and lets mosquitoes drink from his blood, always out of selflessness and compassion and to achieve this highest state of Buddhahood. Ohnuma places these stories into a discrete subgenre of South Asian Buddhist literature and approaches them like case studies, analyzing their plots, characterizations, and rhetoric. She then relates the theme of the Buddha's bodily self-sacrifice to major conceptual discourses in the history of Buddhism and South Asian religions, such as the categories of the gift, the body (both ordinary and extraordinary) , kingship, sacrifice, ritual offering, and death. The work reveals a very sophisticated and influential perception of the body in South Asian Buddhist literature and highlights the way in which these stories have provided an important cultural resource for Buddhists. Combined with her rich and careful translations of classic texts, Ohnuma introduces a whole new understanding of a vital concept in Buddhists studies.","author":[{"family":"Ohnuma","given":"Reiko"}],"citation-key":"Ohnuma 2008a","event-place":"Delhi","file":"","ISBN":"978-81-208-3360-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"372","publisher":"Motilal Banarsidass","publisher-place":"Delhi","title":"Bodily Self Sacrifice in Indian Buddhist Literature","type":"book","URL":"https://www.motilalbanarsidass.com/products/bodily-self-sacrifice-in-indian-buddhist-literature"},

When Communist China invaded Tibet in 1950, it embarked on a program of “reform” that would eventually affect all of Tibet’s citizens and nearly decimate its ancient culture. In 1967, the Chinese destroyed monasteries across Tibet and forced thousands of monks into labor camps and prisons. Gyatso spent the next twenty-five years of his life enduring interrogation and torture simply for the strength of his beliefs. Palden Gyatso’s story bears witness to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the strength of Tibet’s proud civilization, faced with cultural genocide.   “To readers of this memoir, however untraveled, Tibet will never again seem remote or unfamiliar. . . .

  {"id":"Singer 2009b","abstract":"In the second volume, Singer studies the ideas and ideals of medieval courtly love and nineteenth-century Romantic love, as well as the transition between these two perspectives. According to the traditions of courtly love in the twelfth century and thereafter, not only God but also human beings in themselves are capable of authentic love. The pursuit of love between man and woman was seen as a splendid ideal that ennobles both the lover and the beloved. It was something more than libidinal sexuality and involved sophisticated and highly refined courtliness that emulated religious love in its ability to create a holy union between the participants. Adherents to Romantic love in later centuries, affirmed the capacity of love to effect a merging between two people who thus became one. Singer analyzes the transition from courtly to Romantic by reference to the writings of many artists beginning with Dante and ending with Richard Wagner, as well as Neoplatonist philosophers of the Italian Renaissance, Descartes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Hume, Kant, Hegel, and Schopenhauer. In relation to romanticism itself, he distinguishes between two aspects—”benign romanticism” and “Romantic pessimism”—that took on renewed importance in the twentieth century.","author":[{"family":"Singer","given":"Irving"}],"citation-key":"Singer 2009b","collection-title":"The Nature of Love","event-place":"Cambridge, Mass","file":"","ISBN":"978-0-262-51273-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"note":"IACode: natureoflove0002sing_d9a0","number-of-pages":"513","number-of-volumes":"3","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Mass","title":"The Nature of Love, Volume 2: Courtly and Romantic","title-short":"The Nature of Love, Volume 2","type":"book","URL":"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/655008/the-nature-of-love-volume-2-by-irving-singer/","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"Singer 2009c","abstract":"In the third volume, Singer examines the pervasive dialectic between optimistic idealism and pessimistic realism in modern thinking about the nature of love. He begins by discussing “anti-Romantic Romantics” (focusing on Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Tolstoy), influential nineteenth-century thinkers whose views illustrate much of the ambiguity and self-contradiction that permeate thinking about love in the last hundred years. He offers detailed studies of Freud, Proust, Shaw, D. H. Lawrence, and Santayana, and he maps the ideas about love in Continental existentialism, particularly those of Sartre and de Beauvoir. Singer finally envisages a future of cooperation between pluralistic humanists and empirical scientists. This last volume of Singer’s trilogy does not pretend to offer the final word on the subject, any more than do most of the philosophers he discusses, but his masterful work can take its place beside their earlier investigations into these vast and complex questions.","author":[{"family":"Singer","given":"Irving"}],"citation-key":"Singer 2009c","collection-title":"The Nature of Love","event-place":"Cambridge, Mass","file":"","ISBN":"978-0-262-51274-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"note":"IACode: natureoflove0003sing_u7c1","number-of-pages":"473","number-of-volumes":"3","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Mass","title":"The Nature of Love, Volume 3: The Modern World","title-short":"The Nature of Love, Volume 3","type":"book","URL":"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/655010/the-nature-of-love-volume-3-by-irving-singer/","volume":"3"},

In this new book, he maps the trajectory of his thinking on love.\" \"It is a \"partial\" summing-up of a lifework: partial because it expresses the author's still unfolding views, and because love - like any subject of that magnitude - resists a neatly comprehensive, all-inclusive formulation.
