    "ShortAbstract" : "Bhante S. Dhammika combines Buddhist insights with modern psychology to craft a definition of love that cuts through the warm but often unrealistic ideas about love that prevent us from having a clearer and more realistic understanding of it. Drawing upon his many years study of Buddhist scriptures, he explores what the Buddha had to say about romantic love, parental love, love of animals, loving friendship and otehrs. Included also is an in-depth look at mettā, the highest love—what it is, why it is an essential part of the spiritual life",
