  {"id":"Analayo 2011a","abstract":"A thorough examination of each discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya in the light of its parallels.\nIn this thousand-page tome, Bhikkhu Analayo goes systematically through the MN, one sutta at a time, and explains how the Pāli text differs (or not) from its parallels preserved in Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan. Perhaps surprisingly, they don’t differ all that much, though in some places the differences do shed light on the original teaching and shows what kinds of changes occurred to the texts during the process of transmission.\nThe book begins and ends with Bhikkhu Analayo’s reflections on the EBTs and the process of oral transmission, and while the book could certainly be read cover-to-cover, the primary way to use this book is as a reference work alongside the Majjhima Nikaya.","author":[{"family":"Anālayo","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"citation-key":"Analayo 2011a","file":"Anālayo_2011_A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya.pdf;Anālayo_2011_A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya2.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","note":"attachment-label:Vol1;Vol2","publisher":"Dharma Drum Publishing Corporation","title":"A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya","type":"document","URL":"https://www.chancenter.org/chanctr/ddp/ddp.html"},
  {"id":"Bodhi 1995a","abstract":"This book offers a complete translation of the Majjhima Nikāya, or Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, one of the major collections of texts in the Pali Canon, the authorized scriptures of Theravāda Buddhism. This collection—among the oldest records of the historical Buddha’s original teachings—consists of 152 suttas or discourses of middle length, distinguished as such from the longer and shorter suttas of the other collections. The Majjhima Nikāya might be concisely described as the Buddhist scripture that combines the richest variety of contextual settings with the deepest and most comprehensive assortment of teachings. These teachings, which range from basic ethics to instructions in meditation and liberating insight, unfold in a fascinating procession of scenarios that show the Buddha in living dialogue with people from many different strata of ancient Indian society: with kings and princes, priests and ascetics, simple villagers and erudite philosophers. Replete with drama, reasoned argument, and illuminating parable and simile, these discourses exhibit the Buddha in the full glory of his resplendent wisdom, majestic sublimity, and compassionate humanity.\n\nThe translation is based on an original draft translation left by the English scholar-monk Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli, which has been edited and revised by the American monk Bhikkhu Bodhi, who provides a long introduction and helpful explanatory notes. Combining lucidity of expression with accuracy, this translation enables the Buddha to speak across twenty-five centuries in language that addresses the most pressing concerns of the contemporary reader seeking clarification of the timeless issues of truth, value, and the proper conduct of life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,15]]},"citation-key":"Bodhi 1995a","collection-title":"Teachings of the Buddha","contributor":[{"family":"Bodhi","given":"Bhikkhu"},{"family":"Ñāṇamoli","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"event-place":"Boston","file":"","ISBN":"978-0-86171-072-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"language":"en","note":"attachment-label:Contents, Preface, Introduction & Summary of Suttas","number-of-pages":"1424","publisher":"Wisdom Publications","publisher-place":"Boston","title":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikāya","title-short":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha","type":"book","URL":"https://wisdomexperience.org/product/middle-length-discourses-buddha/"},
