<p>The only way of moving towards consensus on the controversial subject of the nature of Nibbāna is by appealing to the sole source of authority common to practically all Buddhists: the Nikāyas/Āgamas. In the present paper I will first give an overview of the usage of the term Nibbāna in the Nikāyas. I will then argue that, according to the Nikāyas, Nibbāna cannot be regarded as a self. Next, I will point out that the Nikāyas do not see Nibbāna as a form of consciousness, including such exceptional kinds of consciousness as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>. Nor can Nibbāna be regarded as equivalent to mind, or any particular state of mind. In the final section I aim to show that the most reasonable interpretation of the Nikāyas is that final Nibbāna is no more than the cessation of the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h1 id='CHAPTER-Introduction'>Introduction</h1>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Nibbāna is the goal of Buddhist practice. As such it is only natural that there is great interest in understanding what it might mean to achieve it. At the same time, Nibbāna is the most profound of Buddhist concepts. It is perhaps not surprising then that the concept of Nibbāna has given rise to a large number of interpretations, some based on meditative experience and others on scriptural study and ‘logical’ deduction, and that many of them are mutually contradictory.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Given this confusing situation, the purpose of the present paper is to try to pin down what the Buddha himself meant by Nibbāna. The only satisfactory way of achieving this is to turn to the suttas, for it is the suttas that are the final arbiter in any Dhamma dispute:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Suppose a monk were to say: ‘… this is the dhamma, this is the discipline (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vinayo</span>), this is the Master’s teaching’, then, monks, you should neither approve nor disapprove his words. Then, without approving or disapproving, his words and expressions should be carefully noted and compared with the suttas and reviewed in light of the discipline. If they, on such comparison and review, are found not to conform to the suttas or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is not the word of the Buddha, it has been wrongly understood by this monk’, and the matter is to be rejected. But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the suttas or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha, it has been rightly understood by this monk.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In the following discussion on the nature of Nibbāna I will therefore base my argument, as far as possible, on the complete contents of the Nikāyas.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> More specifically, I will inquire into the relationship between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> on the one hand and Nibbāna on the other. An understanding of this relationship, as I intend to show, is critical for a proper understanding of Nibbāna. In the final section of this paper, I will discuss Nibbāna itself in greater detail. But to prepare the ground for the ensuing discussion, it is necessary first of all to take a preliminary look at how the suttas employ the term Nibbāna.</p>

<h1 id='CHAPTER-1.-An-Initial-Investigation-into-the-Referents-of-the-term-Nibbāna'>1. An Initial Investigation into the Referents of the term Nibbāna</h1>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There are three frequently mentioned referents of Nibbāna:</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Nibbāna as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion upon the attainment of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship;</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Nibbāna as the ‘state’ that occurs after the death of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>; and</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Nibbāna <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>as the object of consciousness in a special kind of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I will briefly discuss each one of these in turn.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-space">
<p>0</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>1) Whenever Nibbāna is defined in the suttas, it is always in the same way:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>‘The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this, friend, is called Nibbāna’.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is sometimes argued that this ‘destruction’ only refers to the actual event of becoming an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> (<span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, pp.182–185). However, since the destruction is permanent it would seem more likely that Nibbāna here refers to the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion as a general and fundamental characteristic of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Moreover, the event of becoming an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>, that is the final destruction of the defilements, is presumably instantaneous: either one is an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> or one is not. But the narrow focus on momentary events, usually known as mind moments, is a characteristic of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhidhamma</span> and later Pali literature, not the suttas. The suttas normally refer to realities that are extended in time. That this is the case also for the Nibbāna attained at <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship is clear from the following passages:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When lust is abandoned (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rāge pahīne</span>) … when hatred is abandoned … when delusion is abandoned one does not intend for one’s own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both and one does not experience mental pain and dejection. It is in this way, brahmin, that Nibbāna is visible in this very life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">
<p><em>(transl. Brahmāli)</em><br>
AN 3.55:2.2–2.3</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Not intending for one’s own or others’ affliction, and not experiencing mental pain and dejection, cannot be momentary. Nor can Nibbāna be momentary in the following description:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what, monks, is the Nibbāna element with residue remaining? Here, a monk is an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge. However, his five senses remain unimpaired, by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable, still feels pleasure and pain. It is the destruction of lust, hatred, and delusion in him that is called the Nibbāna element with residue remaining.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">
<p>Iti 44:3.1–3.5</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Thus I take Nibbāna in the above definition to refer to that unchanging and permanent aspect of the general state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship which is the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion.<span id="footnote7" class="anchor"></span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> In this sense Nibbāna is an ever-present reality for the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Moreover, since the destruction of the three root defilements is the standard Nikāya explanation of Nibbāna, it seems reasonable to assume that whenever Nibbāna is used without further qualification it refers to this aspect of the state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. This will be my assumption throughout this paper.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what, monks, is the Nibbāna element without residue remaining?

For him, here in this very life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here [i.e. at death]. That, monks, is called the Nibbāna element without residue remaining.</p>

<p><em>(transl. Brahmāli)</em><br>
AN 10.7:5.3–5.5</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> is sometimes said to take Nibbāna as its ‘object’,<span id="footnote12" class="anchor"></span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> i.e. taking the equivalent of final Nibbāna as its object. However, I cannot see how this explanation can be correct. Final Nibbāna by definition is other than <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, which means it is other than the six sense bases and their six corresponding classes of objects. In the Nikāyas, consciousness is always defined by the object it takes and consequently there are precisely six classes of consciousness. For Nibbāna to be an object of consciousness, an entirely new class of consciousness would be required, going beyond the established Nikāya taxonomy.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Indeed, the above quote contains sufficient pointers to make it unlikely that this is a direct reference to Nibbāna. Firstly, perception is specifically said to be present. As in the case of consciousness, perception in the suttas is restricted to six classes, all of which are bound up with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> (SN 22.57:10.1–10.9). There is no room for a direct perception of Nibbāna in this system of classification. Secondly, the perceptions are said to arise and cease, one after the other. Arising and ceasing is a characteristic of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, not Nibbāna: Nibbāna is specifically said to be stable (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhuva</span>; SN 43.20). One would expect a <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> that takes Nibbāna as its object to be stable, much like the stability of perception found in other deep states of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I would therefore propose an alternative interpretation of this passage. It is not Nibbāna as such, but a perception that is based on the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariya’s</span> direct knowledge of the nature of Nibbāna. That is, it is not a perception of Nibbāna but a perception about Nibbāna.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> For convenience I will refer to this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariya-samādhi</span> in the remainder of this paper.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Of these three referents of the term Nibbāna, the first one is relatively straight-forward: it refers to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant’s</span> state of having extinguished all defilements.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> In Nikāya usage this is the usual meaning of Nibbāna. The third referent, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariya-samādhi</span>, does not seem to be a direct reference to Nibbāna at all, but a particular perception based on the full understanding of what Nibbāna is. It is the second referent—that which supervenes at the death of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>—which is the most profound and most often misunderstood. It is Nibbāna in this sense, ‘final Nibbāna’, which will be the main focus of this paper<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">.</span></p>
</div>
<h1 id='CHAPTER-2.-Is-Final-Nibbāna-a-Permanent-Self?'>2. Is Final Nibbāna a Permanent Self?</h1>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is not uncommon to come across attempts to justify the existence of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span> (in the sense of a permanent self) using the Buddha’s teachings and the claim that the end of the Buddhist path is the freeing of this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span> from suffering.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> But the evidence quoted to support such claims is often weak, and it frequently relies on sutta quotes whose interpretation is difficult.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>So let us go through some of the Buddha’s more straightforward statements concerning <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Whether there is an arising of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Tathāgatas</span> or no arising of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Tathāgatas</span>, that element still persists, the stableness of the Dhamma, the fixed course of the Dhamma, that all formations (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhārā</span>) are impermanent … that all formations are suffering … that all things (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhamma</span>) are non-self.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">
<p>AN 3.136:1.11–1.15</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I would suggest that the Buddha uses ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhamma</span>’ in the last phrase to counter any misunderstanding that there might be an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span> outside of conditioned phenomena (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhārā</span>). In this context consider the following:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Monks, as far as there are things (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhamma</span>) conditioned (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhatā</span>) or not conditioned (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">asaṅkhatā</span>), dispassion (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">virāgo</span>) is reckoned best of those things, that is to say … Nibbāna.</p>

<p>Another way of making the same point is as follows:</p>

But do you see any such doctrine of self, bhikkhus?’—‘No, venerable sir’.—‘Good, bhikkhus.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It has been suggested that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> refers to a state of consciousness that is equivalent to final Nibbāna (e.g. <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, p.201),<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> but in light of the discussion of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> in the previous section, such an interpretation is untenable. However, to establish the correct interpretation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> is far from easy. Firstly, in the whole Pali Canon the expression <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> only appears in the above two passages.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> Secondly, Pali verse is notoriously difficult to translate: the correct Pali reading is often difficult to establish and poetic licence etc. can complicate matters further.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Moreover, as in poetry in general, the exact meaning of Pali verse is often vague as its emphasis is on appealing to emotion and intuition rather than on making precise doctrinal statements.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Finally, Pali verse often contains rare words and phrases that sometimes occur nowhere else in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tipiṭaka</span>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, and to show that there are other interpretations of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> that are just as good as or even better than that of a permanent consciousness, I shall put forward an alternative interpretation. To this end, it is necessary to analyse the above quotes in more detail.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The first thing to note is that, due to the qualifiers <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ananta</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhā</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> is described in a way that resembles the description of certain states of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Ananta</span> is closely connected to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>, and it is specifically used in the standard description of the first two immaterial attainments.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Equally important is that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appamāṇa</span>, ‘immeasurable’, which is semantically very close to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ananta</span>,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> is very frequently connected with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. In particular, it is used in the standard passage on the divine abidings (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">brahma-vihāras</span>; e.g. at MN 7:13.1, 16.1), but it is also employed as a general qualifier of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> As for the second qualifier, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhā</span>, it does not seem to be used elsewhere to directly qualify <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. However, the closely related term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhassara</span>, ‘shining’, is often used to describe the mind without hindrances (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nīvaraṇa</span>), the most obvious example of which is the mind in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Thus, given the usage of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ananta</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhā</span> in the above quotes, it seems plausible, perhaps even likely, that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> refers to a state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Next, it is necessary to look more carefully at the structure of the above verses. For the present purposes, an important fact which is rarely pointed out is that the first verse (the ‘question verse’) in the above DN 11:85.11–85.27 passage seems to contain two questions rather than one.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> When we turn to the second verse (the ‘answer verse’), it seems that we are again dealing with two separate answers: otherwise there would be a contradiction between the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> with various attributes described in the first line and the cessation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> described in the last line—consciousness cannot be described as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ</span> and at the same time be said to have ceased. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that the first line of the question verse is answered by the first two lines of the answer verse, and the last two lines of the question verse are answered by the last three lines of the answer verse.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> If this structural analysis is accepted, then it becomes clear that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> is simply a form of consciousness where ‘earth, water, fire and air find no footing’;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> it is not related to the cessation of name-and-form.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>At this point we must consider the second passage quoted above (MN 49:25.1). The wider context of this verse makes it clear that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> is ‘not commensurate with the allness of all’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabbassa sabbattena ananubhūtaṁ</span>), that is, not the same nature as ‘all’. If ‘all’ here is to be understood as ‘all of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>’, then <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> must be based on an awareness or knowledge of ‘what’ lies beyond <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> In other words, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> must refer to a state of consciousness, perhaps a form of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>, possessed by a person who has an ‘outsider’s’ perspective on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, one who has seen the potential for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> to cease.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> This potential is only known to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariyas</span>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Given the above analysis, we are now in a position to be quite specific in our understanding of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span>. We have seen that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> is:</p>

<p>In the first quote above (SN 12.64:6.1–8.8), there is no good reason why <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> should be understood as referring to final Nibbāna. Consciousness is said to be unestablished ‘if there is no delight, if there is no craving’. The reference to absence of craving seems to make it fairly straightforward that this concerns the ordinary consciousness of the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a>60</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The second passage (SN 12.38:3.1–3.5) concerns a person who ‘does not intend’, ‘does not plan’, and ‘does not have a tendency towards anything’. His consciousness is then unestablished and ‘there is no descent of name-and-form’. If, as seems likely, descent of name-and-form refers to future rebirth, then the unestablished consciousness must refer to the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. Indeed, the suttas immediately preceding and following this one, which are direct parallels to it, explicitly mention ‘future rebirth’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatiṁ punabbhavābhinibbatti</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatiṁ jāti</span> respectively) where the present sutta mentions descent of name-and-form. This leaves little doubt that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> also in the present sutta refers to the consciousness of the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. Moreover, the expression ‘when consciousness is unestablished … there is no descent of name-and-form’ seems to indicate that this concerns consciousness in general, not a specific state. thus, again, this seems to be a reference to an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">’s</span> general state of consciousness.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The third passage (SN 4.23:10.6) is more ambiguous, but it can easily be understood to mean that Godhika’s consciousness was unestablished at the time of death.

<p>Elsewhere, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> are used together to refer to the same thing: ‘When in his mother’s womb the first thought (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cittaṁ</span>) has arisen, the first consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇaṁ</span>) appeared, his birth is (to be reckoned) from that time’ (<span data-custom-style="Hyperlink"><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali?layout=sidebyside&amp;reference=main/pts&amp;notes=asterisk&amp;highlight=false&amp;script=latin#75.1.8">Kd 1</a>:75.1.8</span>).<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>If, as suggested by <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, one sees the Nikāyas as including a doctrine of two fundamentally different types of consciousness, i.e. a <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samsāric</span> consciousness and a timeless <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbānic</span> consciousness, then, in view of the close relationship between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>, one would expect the Nikāyas to make a similar distinction between two fundamentally different types of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discussion so far has emphasised that, according to the Nikāyas, final Nibbāna cannot be regarded as some sort of permanent or timeless consciousness or mind and that it cannot be regarded as a self (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span>). But highlighting what final Nibbāna <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>is not obviously begs the question: What then is final Nibbāna? Indeed, it might be asked, is it anything at all apart from the cessation of existence?<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Before I attempt to answer this question, it is necessary to investigate a number of sutta passages that concern Nibbāna more directly. These passages are often referred to as evidence that final Nibbāna is some sort of ‘state’<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> (see for instance <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Bodhi 2005</span>, p.318).<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a> But I would contend that they do not need to be interpreted in this way.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Sometimes Nibbāna is called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbānadhātu</span>, e.g. at SN 45.7:2.4.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> The word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span> is often translated as ‘element’. Basing one’s understanding on this translation it is natural to conclude that Nibbāna must be ‘something’. However, this would be to ignore the range of meanings of the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span>.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a> In addition to meaning ‘element’, it also has the sense of ‘property’ (see <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">PED</span>).<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a> This meaning is prominent in such compounds as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nirodha-dhātu</span> (Iti 51:2.3), ‘the property of cessation’, and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nekkhamma-dhātu</span> (SN 14.12:7.2), ‘the property of renunciation’.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a> Indeed, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbānadhātu</span> itself is explained at SN 45.7:2.1–2.6, as nothing other than ‘the removal (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vinayo</span>) of lust, the removal of hatred and the removal of delusion’. Here, again, it is the property aspect which is to the fore, and the best translation would perhaps be ‘the property of extinguishment’.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another set of suttas, at SN 43.12/SN 43.13/SN 43.14-43, present 32 synonyms for Nibbāna. This could easily be regarded as evidence of final Nibbāna as an existing ‘state’. However, in this case we need to be careful to distinguish between Nibbāna as an aspect of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship (i.e. the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion) and final Nibbāna. Because all these suttas are about the destruction of the defilements they would seem to concern <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The first part of this quote, ‘where there is no earth … neither moon nor sun’, is identical to the standard description of what I call ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariya-samādhi</span>’.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a> That we are here dealing with a state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> would fit well with the use of the word ‘base’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span>, which is often used of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> attainments.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The second part of the quote, ‘it is not coming, going or remaining, not passing away or reappearing; it is unestablished, not moving, without basis (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">neva āgatiṁ … na gatiṁ na ṭhitiṁ na cutiṁ na upapattiṁ, appatiṭṭhitaṁ appavattaṁ anārammaṇamevetaṁ</span>)’, seems to be nothing other than a description of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. The initial phrase, ‘no coming … or reappearing’, elsewhere refers to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship (see Ud 8.4:3.5, MN 144:11.6–11.7 and cf. SN 12.40:1.5–1.6, 2.4–2.5, 3.4–3.5): there is no future coming, going, passing away, or reappearing for the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> as he has cut these things off. They cease here and now because their cause has been removed.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a> That ‘unestablished’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span>, also refers to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship, I have already shown in the above section on ‘unestablished consciousness’. ‘Without basis’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anārammaṇa</span>,<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a> is often found together with ‘unestablished’ (SN 12.38, SN 12.39 &amp; SN 12.40) and would therefore also seem to refer to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. ‘Not moving’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appavatta</span>, does not seem to be encountered elsewhere in the Nikāyas, but it appears to be a simple reference to ‘not moving in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>’, being the opposite of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pavatta</span>, ‘moving on’/‘going on’. Again, it seems natural to identify this with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The final line of the verse, ‘just this is the end of suffering’, would normally refer to the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. ‘Just this is the end of suffering’, or more commonly ‘the end of suffering’, is a standard way of describing the attainment of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship, e.g. at MN 144:11.3–11.9. In sum, the above passage at Ud 8.1:3.1–3.4 seems to describe something related to both <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariya-samādhi</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. It seems clear therefore that it must relate to Nibbāna, with final Nibbāna perhaps being the most likely candidate.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a> But even if this is the case, the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span>, like the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span>, is used so broadly in the Nikāyas that this would still not be decisive in showing that final Nibbāna is a ‘state’. At AN 9.36, AN 9.43 and AN 9.44, for example, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> is used to describe <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saññāvedayitanirodha</span>, an attainment where the mental aggregates temporarily cease. Clearly <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> cannot refer to an ‘existing entity’ in such a context.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The other sutta of interest from the Udāna reads as follows:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

Having understood that he is subject to birth, the Buddha-to-be seeks the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ajātaṁ</span>. If birth is a problem, then surely the natural thing to do is to seek a freedom from birth, not a ‘state’ that is unborn.<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a> The most reasonable translation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ajātaṁ</span>, therefore, would seem to be ‘freedom from what is born’ or ‘freedom from birth’.<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a> If this is accepted, it is natural to translate all the initial a’s at Ud 8.3:3.1–3.4 as privatives, that is, as ‘freedom from’.

In my opinion, all this passage does is to affirm the possibility of ending <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> Indeed, this is precisely the broader context of this extract.<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>None of the passages discussed in this section need be read as descriptions of final Nibbāna, let alone as final Nibbāna being ‘something’ in a positive sense.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reason why the above analysis has not produced any decisive result regarding the nature of final Nibbāna is simply that the suttas very rarely seem to speak of final Nibbāna; their emphasis is on Nibbāna during life, the experience of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. Nevertheless, we have seen that final Nibbāna cannot be equated with a form of consciousness or mind. Indeed, it is clear that it must be other than the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>. This being the case, could final Nibbāna be a ‘state’, some sort of ‘existing entity’, quite separate from the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The idea that final Nibbāna is an ‘existing entity’ is usually matched with the idea that this ‘state’ can be experienced while the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> is still alive.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a> In fact, these two ideas of necessity go together: if the final Nibbāna ‘state’ was not experienceable by living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahants</span>, they would not know of its existence and consequently there could be no record of it for posterity. But the idea that final Nibbāna <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>can be experienced by the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> is doctrinally problematic. An experience of something—without which one cannot know that it exists—by definition includes consciousness. Thus, an experience of the equivalent of final Nibbāna while alive must involve consciousness. Indeed, this is also the standard explanation for how Nibbāna is said to be experienced: the mind or consciousness takes it as its object.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The problem with this idea is that it does not fit the Nikāyas’ explanation of consciousness. As I have already pointed out in the introduction to this paper, consciousness is always defined by the object it takes and thus there are precisely six classes of consciousness, one for each of the five senses and one for the mind (e.g. at SN 22.57:14.1–14.4). There is no indication anywhere of any further classes of consciousness. Yet the idea of final Nibbāna as an object of consciousness would require a seventh class of consciousness: it does not fit into any of the six classes mentioned in the suttas.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a> Thus, to see consciousness as taking final Nibbāna as its object is to go beyond fixed sutta categories and therefore a baseless extension of what appears to be a full description of reality in the Nikāyas.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>More generally, is it sensible to speak of a final Nibbāna ‘state’ that is entirely other than the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>? If consciousness ceases once and for all, what could final Nibbāna possibly be? It makes no sense to speak of a ‘state’ which by definition cannot be known. Such a state becomes a mere cipher, something completely devoid of meaning. It is tantamount to not existing at all.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>That the idea of final Nibbāna being a ‘state’ is a weak one, is also clear from the principle of Occam’s razor. This philosophical principle states that ‘the fewest possible assumptions are to be made in explaining things’.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a> In the present case, all ideas of final Nibbāna being an ‘existing reality’ produce complications—and therefore a need for further assumptions<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>—that make these ideas less compelling according to Occam’s razor. The simplest explanation of what happens at final Nibbāna is simply that the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> cease. The simplicity and directness of this idea and its fit, as I have tried to show, with all aspects of the teachings found in the Nikāyas, makes it by far the strongest candidate for explaining final Nibbāna.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Finally, I wish to point out one remaining danger with insisting that final Nibbāna is a ‘state’ of ‘something’. For a <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puthujjana</span> such a ‘state’ would be quite literally unimaginable.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a> In trying to understand it, he would quite naturally employ some version of the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>. Anyone who accepts the Buddha’s teaching that final Nibbāna is the highest happiness would therefore almost unavoidably grasp at or attach to that version of the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>. Because the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> can manifest in extremely subtle ways—for instance, for anyone who has not experienced it, it would be virtually impossible to imagine what the experience of the base of nothingness is like—one would quite likely not even be aware of one’s attachment. In this way one ends up grasping the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>—that is, grasping what is in reality suffering—thinking it to be final Nibbāna. And instead of reaching final Nibbāna one ends up perpetuating <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>. The view that final Nibbāna is just cessation is thus not only the one that seems most in tune with the Nikāyas but also the one that quite pragmatically is most likely to lead to an exit from <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

Consciousness is impermanent; what is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering has ceased and passed away”. Being asked thus, friend, I would answer in such a way’.</p>

<p>This, then, is what really happens at the death of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. Because human beings, including <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahants</span>, are nothing more than an impersonal process (i.e. devoid of a stable self) which is impermanent and suffering, all that happens when an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> dies is that this process comes to an end. From the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahants</span>’ point of view the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> have nothing to do with them;<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a> nor are they anything apart from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>, as we have seen in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Yamaka Sutta</span>. Moreover, because the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> are suffering, their cessation can only be a good thing. The death of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> is just the end, the cessation, of an unwanted process. Nothing of value is being lost; nothing is being annihilated.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a> This is why the death of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>does not count as annihilation. The reason an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> is not annihilated at death has nothing to do with the nature of final Nibbāna.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a></p>

<p>If the cessation of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> is the full end of suffering and thus the highest possible happiness, then one would expect the attainment of the ‘cessation of perception and feeling’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saññāvedayitanirodha</span>, to be the same.

<p>Should anyone say: ‘that [i.e. the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception] is the utmost pleasure (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sukhaṁ</span>) and joy (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">somanassaṁ</span>) that beings experience’, I would not concede that to him. Why is that? Because there is another kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than that pleasure. And what is that other kind of pleasure? Here, Ānanda, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The idea that final Nibbāna is nothing apart from the cessation of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> might seem bleak. If it seems bleak, it is only due to the false sense of having a permanent self, or more precisely, because of the view of personal identity, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sakkāya-diṭṭhi</span>.<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122" role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a> The sense that one has a permanent core—a distortion of perception that is unavoidable for all <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puthujjanas</span>—makes cessation appear like annihilation and the successful practice of the path like a form of suicide. If cessation seems undesirable, it is only due to this distorted outlook.</p>

<p>Consider the following discussion between Ven. Sāriputta and Ven. Mahā-Koṭṭhita:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>[Mahā-Koṭṭhita:] ‘Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six spheres of sense contact (i.e. final Nibbāna), is there anything else? … is there not anything else?’ …</p>

<p>By asking ‘is there anything else?’ and ‘is there not anything else?’ the questioner reveals his distorted outlook, his preoccupation and concern about the fate of his non-existing self.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a> This is why Sāriputta calls the questions <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">papañca</span>, ‘proliferation’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">papañca</span> being the distorted thinking process that arises from a distorted perception of reality.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puthujjana</span> is trapped by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sakkāya</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">-</span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">diṭṭhi</span>, by the perception of a permanent core in himself. But from his own point of view, whether he is aware of it or not, he is simply concerned with the destiny of what he sees as his own true essence.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But if the illusion of personal identity is seen through, if the perceived solid core is seen not to exist, there is nothing to be concerned about any more.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a> When it is seen that all a being is made up of are the ever-impermanent <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>, utterly tied up with suffering, then cessation becomes the most desirable thing possible. Questions such as ‘is there anything else?’ and ‘is there not anything else?’ are quite simply beside the point.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127" role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the final analysis, the Buddha’s teachings concern only the ending of suffering. Although it seems clear that ‘mere’ cessation is the correct interpretation of final Nibbāna and although there are obvious dangers in regarding final Nibbāna as ‘something’, ultimately it is irrelevant whether the state that supervenes when the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> dies is ‘something’ or ‘nothing’. All that matters is that the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>—that is, suffering—cease without remainder. Consider how the Buddha sometimes would summarise his teachings: ‘Good, good, Anurādha. Formerly, Anurādha, and also now, I make known just suffering and the cessation of suffering’ (SN 22.86:13.1–13.2).<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a> And since suffering is coterminous with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, it follows that ‘Nibbāna is the greatest bliss’ (MN 75:21.5 and Dhp 204). What more can you ask for?</p>
