This shows the close relationship between Nibbāna and <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship in general. Harvey tries to show at some length that Nibbāna here refers to the event of attaining <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship, not an aspect of the general state of <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship. His first argument is that the Pali terminology points to an event rather than an ongoing reality. Without going into detail, it seems to me that the terminology is open to either interpretation, but most likely it refers to both. His second and main argument is based on the fact that Nibbāna is the end of <span lang='pi'>dukkha</span> whereas the <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> still has some <span lang='pi'>dukkha</span> remaining and thus the general state of <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship cannot be called Nibbāna. But Nibbāna at <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship is called Nibbāna ‘with residue remaining’ Iti 44:3.1–3.5, the residue being the experience of ‘what is agreeable and disagreeable … pleasure and pain (<span lang='pi'>dukkha</span>)’.

Nibbāna as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion is therefore simply the permanent extinguishing of these three defilements. In fact, Nibbāna is a relative term in the suttas, its precise connotation depending on what is being extinguished. At AN 9.47, AN 9.48, AN 9.49, AN 9.50 and AN 9.51 each jhāna and each immaterial attainment is said to be ‘provisional Nibbāna (<span lang='pi'>nibbānaṁ … pariyāyena</span>)’. ‘Non-provisional Nibbāna’ is reached at <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship, and ‘final Nibbāna’ at the death of the <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> (see below).

    "fnHTML": "<p>Nibbāna cannot simply be classified as a mind object—with the corresponding consciousness being mind-consciousness—since all mind objects and their corresponding objects are said to be impermanent and suffering; see e.g. SN 35.32. Indeed, the Salāyatana-Saṁyutta contains a large number of suttas that directly state that mental phenomena (dhammas) are suffering. These statements often have an almost equational quality. And there is no clear statement anywhere in the suttas that there are any exceptions to this. In fact the six senses together with their six objects are called ‘the all’ (SN 35.23), clearly indicating that there are no further senses or sense objects apart from these. These statements taken together make it impossible, to my mind, to accept the idea of Nibbāna as a mind object cognised by mind-consciousness.

Harvey does not in fact use the words ‘permanent consciousness’ in describing final Nibbāna. Instead, he says final Nibbāna is a ‘stopped discernment’ (<span class='sesame' data-sesame-key='zotref:'>Harvey 1995</span>, p.201; ‘discernment’ being Harvey’s translation of <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span>) or ‘consciousness beyond time’ (208). (He also argues that this ‘timeless’ Nibbāna can be periodically experienced by the <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> during life, 208). But the idea that <span lang='pi'>nirodha</span> can be understood as a ‘stopped state’ rather than just ‘cessation’ is not supported by the use of <span lang='pi'>nirodha</span> in the Nikāyas. Wherever its meaning is unambiguous it means ‘ending’, ‘cessation’; there is never any sense that it refers to a ‘state’. To make his point Harvey also employs the double meaning in English of the word ‘stopped’. For him a ‘stopped discernment’ is thus a consciousness that stands still, continuing without change, not a consciousness that has ended. In Pali, however, <span lang='pi'>nirodha</span>/<span lang='pi'>niruddha</span> has no such double meaning, it only means ‘stopped’ as in ‘ceased’ or ‘ended’.</p><p>As for Harvey’s use of the phrase ‘consciousness beyond time’, as opposed to ‘permanent consciousness’, it is difficult to see that it makes any difference. As a general tool of interpretation, it seems clear that the Nikāyas cannot possibly refute every single formulation that constitutes a contradiction to their outlook. In many cases, such as the present one, one has to make reasonable assumptions as to the implications of the suttas’ statements. As far as I can see, a consciousness beyond time would for all practical purposes be the same as a permanent consciousness, since it is change that gives rise to a perception of time. Moreover, since Nibbāna is specifically said to be <span lang='pi'>dhuva</span>, ‘stable’ (SN 43.20), which in the suttas is used as a synonym for <span lang='pi'>nicca</span>, ‘permanent’, the idea of ‘consciousness beyond time’ as opposed to ‘permanent consciousness’ seems to be a red herring.</p>"

In the suttas name-and-form is usually understood to encompass all phenomena apart from consciousness.</p><p>It is significant that the Chinese version of these verses (at T I 102c, 14–19) supports the above analysis. The question verse of the Chinese is virtually identical with the question verse of the Pali. (In both versions, this verse is the Buddha’s reformulation of the original single question into two questions.) The answer verse is as follows: ‘one should answer (應答): “Consciousness without form (識無形); infinite, self-illuminating (無量自有光); when this ceases then the four great [elements] cease (此滅四大滅); gross, subtle, beautiful, ugly cease (麤細好醜滅滅); therefore name-and-form cease (於此名色滅); consciousness ceases, remainder also ceases (識滅餘亦滅)”‘. Here it is quite clear that we have two answers. The first one is ‘consciousness without form, infinite, self-illuminating’. This would then be the answer to the first question about where the four elements cease or find no footing. Since the second line begins ‘when this ceases …’, ‘this’ presumably referring back to the consciousness without form of the previous line (it is difficult to see what else it might refer to), this must be a second answer. This answer would correspond to the second question, concerning where name and form wholly cease. (Admittedly, the Chinese is a bit confusing here, since it starts the second answer with ‘then the four great elements cease’. I take this mention of the four great elements as simply an elaboration on some of the aspects of name-and-form.) Moreover, it is clear in the Chinese that the ‘consciousness without form’ cannot be a reference to Nibbāna since it ceases together with all other phenomena.</p>"

However, according to the Sri Lankan, the Thai, and the PTS versions of this verse, it is spoken by Baka the Brahmā, referring to his special understanding (see <span class='sesame'>Anālayo 2011</span>, footnote 162 to MN 49).

This interpretation is further reinforced by the Chinese version of this sutta, also according to which it was Brahmā who spoke, see T I 548b, 11. (It is also significant that in the Chinese there is no equivalent of <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span>.)
