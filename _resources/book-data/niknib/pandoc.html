<p>Introduction</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Nibbāna is the goal of Buddhist practice. As such it is only natural that there is great interest in understanding what it might mean to achieve it. At the same time, Nibbāna is the most profound of Buddhist concepts. It is perhaps not surprising then that the concept of Nibbāna has given rise to a large number of interpretations, some based on meditative experience and others on scriptural study and ‘logical’ deduction, and that many of them are mutually contradictory.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Given this confusing situation, the purpose of the present paper is to try to pin down what the Buddha himself meant by Nibbāna. The only satisfactory way of achieving this is to turn to the suttas, for it is the suttas that are the final arbiter in any Dhamma dispute:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Suppose a monk were to say: ‘… this is the dhamma, this is the discipline (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vinayo</span>), this is the Master’s teaching’, then, monks, you should neither approve nor disapprove his words. Then, without approving or disapproving, his words and expressions should be carefully noted and compared with the suttas and reviewed in light of the discipline. If they, on such comparison and review, are found not to conform to the suttas or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is not the word of the Buddha, it has been wrongly understood by this monk’, and the matter is to be rejected. But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the suttas or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha, it has been rightly understood by this monk’.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the following discussion on the nature of Nibbāna I will therefore base my argument, as far as possible, on the complete contents of the Nikāyas.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> More specifically, I will inquire into the relationship between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> on the one hand and Nibbāna on the other. An understanding of this relationship, as I intend to show, is critical for a proper understanding of Nibbāna. In the final section of this paper, I will discuss Nibbāna itself in greater detail. But to prepare the ground for the ensuing discussion, it is necessary first of all to take a preliminary look at how the suttas employ the term Nibbāna.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-Chapter">
<p>1. An Initial Investigation into the Referents of the term Nibbāna</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There are three frequently mentioned referents of Nibbāna:</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Nibbāna as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion upon the attainment of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship;</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Nibbāna as the ‘state’ that occurs after the death of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>; and</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Nibbāna <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>as the object of consciousness in a special kind of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I will briefly discuss each one of these in turn.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-space">
<p>0</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>1) Whenever Nibbāna is defined in the suttas, it is always in the same way:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>‘The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this, friend, is called Nibbāna’.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is sometimes argued that this ‘destruction’ only refers to the actual event of becoming an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> (<span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, pp.182–185). However, since the destruction is permanent it would seem more likely that Nibbāna here refers to the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion as a general and fundamental characteristic of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Moreover, the event of becoming an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>, that is the final destruction of the defilements, is presumably instantaneous: either one is an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> or one is not. But the narrow focus on momentary events, usually known as mind moments, is a characteristic of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span> and later Pali literature, not the suttas. The suttas normally refer to realities that are extended in time. That this is the case also for the Nibbāna attained at <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship is clear from the following passages:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When lust is abandoned (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rāge pahīne</span>) … when hatred is abandoned … when delusion is abandoned one does not intend for one’s own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both and one does not experience mental pain and dejection. It is in this way, brahmin, that Nibbāna is visible in this very life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">
<p><em>(transl. Brahmāli)</em><br />
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 3.55:2.2–2.3</span></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Not intending for one’s own or others’ affliction, and not experiencing mental pain and dejection, cannot be momentary. Nor can Nibbāna be momentary in the following description:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what, monks, is the Nibbāna element with residue remaining? Here, a monk is an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge. However, his five senses remain unimpaired, by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable, still feels pleasure and pain. It is the destruction of lust, hatred, and delusion in him that is called the Nibbāna element with residue remaining.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Iti 44:3.1–3.5</span></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Thus I take Nibbāna in the above definition to refer to that unchanging and permanent aspect of the general state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship which is the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion.<span id="footnote7" class="anchor"></span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> In this sense Nibbāna is an ever-present reality for the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Moreover, since the destruction of the three root defilements is the standard Nikāya explanation of Nibbāna, it seems reasonable to assume that whenever Nibbāna is used without further qualification it refers to this aspect of the state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. This will be my assumption throughout this paper.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-space">
<p>0</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>2) Occasionally Nibbāna is used to describe the ‘state’ that occurs after the death of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what, monks, is the Nibbāna element without residue remaining? Here a monk is an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge. For him, here in this very life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here [i.e. at death]. That, monks, is called the Nibbāna element without residue remaining.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">

<p>In the following I will refer to this as ‘final Nibbāna’.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In the suttas, only very rarely does the word Nibbāna unambiguously refer to final Nibbāna.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>3) In a few places the suttas mention a type of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> that is attainable only by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariyas</span>:<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Just as, friend, in a burning wood-fire, one flame arises and another flame ceases, so too ‘the cessation of existence is Nibbāna, the cessation of existence is Nibbāna (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ, bhavanirodho nibbānan ti</span>)’, one perception (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saññā</span>) arose in me, friend, and another perception ceased, ‘the cessation of existence is Nibbāna’; and yet, on that occasion I was percipient (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saññī</span>).</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">
<p><em>(transl. Brahmāli)</em><br />
<a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 10.7:5.3–5.5</span></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> is sometimes said to take Nibbāna as its ‘object’,<span id="footnote12" class="anchor"></span><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> i.e. taking the equivalent of final Nibbāna as its object. However, I cannot see how this explanation can be correct. Final Nibbāna by definition is other than <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, which means it is other than the six sense bases and their six corresponding classes of objects. In the Nikāyas, consciousness is always defined by the object it takes and consequently there are precisely six classes of consciousness. For Nibbāna to be an object of consciousness, an entirely new class of consciousness would be required, going beyond the established Nikāya taxonomy.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Indeed, the above quote contains sufficient pointers to make it unlikely that this is a direct reference to Nibbāna. Firstly, perception is specifically said to be present. As in the case of consciousness, perception in the suttas is restricted to six classes, all of which are bound up with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 22.57:10.1–10.9</span></a>). There is no room for a direct perception of Nibbāna in this system of classification. Secondly, the perceptions are said to arise and cease, one after the other. Arising and ceasing is a characteristic of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, not Nibbāna: Nibbāna is specifically said to be stable (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhuva</span>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 43.20</span></a>). One would expect a <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> that takes Nibbāna as its object to be stable, much like the stability of perception found in other deep states of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I would therefore propose an alternative interpretation of this passage. It is not Nibbāna as such, but a perception that is based on the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariya’s</span> direct knowledge of the nature of Nibbāna. That is, it is not a perception of Nibbāna but a perception about Nibbāna.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> For convenience I will refer to this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariya samādhi</span> in the remainder of this paper.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Of these three referents of the term Nibbāna, the first one is relatively straight-forward: it refers to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant’s</span> state of having extinguished all defilements.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> In Nikāya usage this is the usual meaning of Nibbāna. The third referent, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariya samādhi</span>, does not seem to be a direct reference to Nibbāna at all, but a particular perception based on the full understanding of what Nibbāna is. It is the second referent—that which supervenes at the death of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>—which is the most profound and most often misunderstood. It is Nibbāna in this sense, ‘final Nibbāna’, which will be the main focus of this paper.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is not uncommon to come across attempts to justify the existence of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span> (in the sense of a permanent self) using the Buddha’s teachings and the claim that the end of the Buddhist path is the freeing of this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span> from suffering.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> But the evidence quoted to support such claims is often weak, and it frequently relies on sutta quotes whose interpretation is difficult.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>So let us go through some of the Buddha’s more straightforward statements concerning <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Whether there is an arising of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Tathāgatas</span> or no arising of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Tathāgatas</span>, that element still persists, the stableness of the Dhamma, the fixed course of the Dhamma, that all formations (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhārā</span>) are impermanent … that all formations are suffering … that all things (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhamma</span>) are non-self.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I would suggest that the Buddha uses ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhamma</span>’ in the last phrase to counter any misunderstanding that there might be an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span> outside of conditioned phenomena (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhārā</span>). In this context consider the following:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Monks, as far as there are things (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhamma</span>) conditioned (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhatā</span>) or not conditioned (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">asaṅkhatā</span>), dispassion (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">virāgo</span>) is reckoned best of those things, that is to say … Nibbāna.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Dhamma</span>’ is thus a wider term than ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>’. It includes anything that might fall outside of conditioned phenomena, in particular Nibbāna.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another way of making the same point is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>‘Bhikkhus, you may well cling to that doctrine of self (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attavādupādānaṁ upādiyetha</span>) that would not arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who clings to it. But do you see any such doctrine of self, bhikkhus?’—‘No, venerable sir’.—‘Good, bhikkhus. I too do not see any doctrine of self that would not arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who clings to it’.</p>

<p>Clinging causes suffering because the object of clinging sooner or later changes.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But the fact is that the Buddha did not recommend any sort of clinging:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When, Nāgita, one dwells contemplating the rise and fall in regard to the five aggregates affected by clinging, repulsiveness in respect of clinging (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāne pāṭikkūlyatā</span>) is established.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Bhikkhus, since a self and what belongs to a self are not apprehended as true and established, then this standpoint for views, namely, ‘This is self, this the world; after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity’—would it not be an utterly and completely foolish teaching?</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is sometimes argued that even if there is no <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">attā</span>, the purpose of the Buddhist training is to attain a permanent form of consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> But if there were such a thing as a permanent consciousness devoid of suffering, that would be precisely the sort of phenomenon that the Buddha would describe as a self: it is the characteristics of impermanence and suffering that make the description of something as ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span>’ impossible.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> If this argument is accepted, it follows that the idea of a permanent consciousness that is ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anattā</span>’ is inherently self-contradictory.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It might also be noted here that the mere absence of the thought or perception ‘I am’ in certain states of deep <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> does not mean that by attaining those states one has penetrated the Buddha’s teaching of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anattā</span>.

<p>It has been suggested that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> refers to a state of consciousness that is equivalent to final Nibbāna (e.g. <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, p.201),<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> but in light of the discussion of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> in the previous section, such an interpretation is untenable. However, to establish the correct interpretation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> is far from easy. Firstly, in the whole Pali Canon the expression <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> only appears in the above two passages.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> Secondly, Pali verse is notoriously difficult to translate: the correct Pali reading is often difficult to establish and poetic licence etc. can complicate matters further.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Moreover, as in poetry in general, the exact meaning of Pali verse is often vague as its emphasis is on appealing to emotion and intuition rather than on making precise doctrinal statements.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> Finally, Pali verse often contains rare words and phrases that sometimes occur nowhere else in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tipiṭaka</span>.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p>The first thing to note is that, due to the qualifiers <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ananta</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhā</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> is described in a way that resembles the description of certain states of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Ananta</span> is closely connected to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>, and it is specifically used in the standard description of the first two immaterial attainments.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> Equally important is that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appamāṇa</span>, ‘immeasurable’, which is semantically very close to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ananta</span>,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> is very frequently connected with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. In particular, it is used in the standard passage on the divine abidings (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">brahmavihāras</span>; e.g. at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">MN 7:13.1, 16.1</span></a>), but it is also employed as a general qualifier of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> As for the second qualifier, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhā</span>, it does not seem to be used elsewhere to directly qualify <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. However, the closely related term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhassara</span>, ‘shining’, is often used to describe the mind without hindrances (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nīvaraṇa</span>), the most obvious example of which is the mind in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> Thus, given the usage of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ananta</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhā</span> in the above quotes, it seems plausible, perhaps even likely, that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> refers to a state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Next, it is necessary to look more carefully at the structure of the above verses. For the present purposes, an important fact which is rarely pointed out is that the first verse (the ‘question verse’) in the above <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">DN 11:85.11–85.27</span></a> passage seems to contain two questions rather than one.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> When we turn to the second verse (the ‘answer verse’), it seems that we are again dealing with two separate answers: otherwise there would be a contradiction between the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> with various attributes described in the first line and the cessation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> described in the last line—consciousness cannot be described as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ</span> and at the same time be said to have ceased. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that the first line of the question verse is answered by the first two lines of the answer verse, and the last two lines of the question verse are answered by the last three lines of the answer verse.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> If this structural analysis is accepted, then it becomes clear that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> is simply a form of consciousness where ‘earth, water, fire and air find no footing’;<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> it is not related to the cessation of name-and-form.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>At this point we must consider the second passage quoted above (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">MN 49:25.1</span></a>). The wider context of this verse makes it clear that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> is ‘not commensurate with the allness of all’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabbassa sabbattena ananubhūtaṁ</span>), that is, not the same nature as ‘all’. If ‘all’ here is to be understood as ‘all of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>’, then <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> must be based on an awareness or knowledge of ‘what’ lies beyond <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> In other words, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> must refer to a state of consciousness, perhaps a form of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>, possessed by a person who has an ‘outsider’s’ perspective on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, one who has seen the potential for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> to cease.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> This potential is only known to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariyas</span>.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Given the above analysis, we are now in a position to be quite specific in our understanding of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span>. We have seen that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> is:</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The sutta phrase <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, ‘unestablished consciousness’, is sometimes taken as referring to final Nibbāna. In this way final Nibbāna is again seen as a ‘state’ of consciousness (see in particular <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, pp.201–203).<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> The following three sutta passages are sometimes used to support this assertion:</p>

<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 4.23:10.6</span></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the first quote above (SN 12.64:6.1–8.8), there is no good reason why <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> should be understood as referring to final Nibbāna. Consciousness is said to be unestablished ‘if there is no delight, if there is no craving’. The reference to absence of craving seems to make it fairly straightforward that this concerns the ordinary consciousness of the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The second passage (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 12.38:3.1–3.5</span></a>) concerns a person who ‘does not intend’, ‘does not plan’, and ‘does not have a tendency towards anything’. His consciousness is then unestablished and ‘there is no descent of name-and-form’. If, as seems likely, descent of name-and-form refers to future rebirth, then the unestablished consciousness must refer to the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. Indeed, the suttas immediately preceding and following this one, which are direct parallels to it, explicitly mention ‘future rebirth’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatiṁ punabbhavābhinibbatti</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatiṁ jāti</span> respectively) where the present sutta mentions descent of name-and-form. This leaves little doubt that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> also in the present sutta refers to the consciousness of the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. Moreover, the expression ‘when consciousness is unestablished … there is no descent of name-and-form’ seems to indicate that this concerns consciousness in general, not a specific state. thus, again, this seems to be a reference to an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">’s</span> general state of consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The third passage (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 4.23:10.6</span></a>) is more ambiguous, but it can easily be understood to mean that Godhika’s consciousness was unestablished at the time of death. In other words, there is no need to bring in any theory of final Nibbāna consciousness that, in my opinion, clearly contradicts the suttas’ general message on the subject.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Finally, there are still other passages in the suttas where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> clearly refers to the general consciousness of the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When that consciousness is unestablished (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">apatiṭṭhitaṁ</span>),<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> not coming to growth, non-generative, it is liberated. By being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In sum, all the available evidence suggests that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> is a reference to the ordinary consciousness of the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. Although the suttas do not seem to contain an outright denial that this consciousness applies to final Nibbāna, there is no passage that unambiguously states that it does. In these circumstances, it seems to me little more than speculation to suggest that unestablished consciousness refers to a ‘state’ of final Nibbāna. And given that the existence of a permanent consciousness is explicitly denied elsewhere (see above), it becomes untenable.</p>

<p>6. Could Citta (Mind) be a Referent of Final Nibbāna?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Is it reasonable, as is sometimes done, to use the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> (mind), or a particular state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>, as a synonym for Nibbāna?<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> There is no clear evidence in the suttas of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> ever being used in this way and, as I shall now try to show, the evidence to the contrary is compelling.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Citta</span> refers to what in English one would understand by ‘mind’. In the Nikāyas, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> often has a broader scope than <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>, sometimes referring to intention for example and at other times to thought.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> Despite this distinction between the two terms,<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> they are nevertheless closely related. In fact, they are often used synonymously. For example, there are several instances in the suttas where one term appears where one would normally expect to find the other:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>‘When that consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇaṁ</span>) is unestablished, not coming to growth, non-generative, it is liberated (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vimuttaṁ</span>)’.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Usually it is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> which is said to be liberated. Another example of this is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>‘With the origination of name-and-form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpasamudayā</span>) there is the origination of mind (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cittassa samudayo</span>). With the cessation of name-and-form there is the passing away of mind’.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is usually <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> which is said to be thus conditioned by name-and-form. But as the context here is the four <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhānas</span>, the third of which is mind contemplation (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cittānupassana</span>), <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> is used instead.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Where the suttas analyse the mind into mental factors, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> usually forms part of the list. In the following passage, however, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> is used in place of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Elsewhere, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> are used together to refer to the same thing: ‘When in his mother’s womb the first thought (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cittaṁ</span>) has arisen, the first consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇaṁ</span>) appeared, his birth is (to be reckoned) from that time’ (<span data-custom-style="Hyperlink"><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#75.1.8">Kd 1</a>:75.1.8</span>).<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This interchangeability of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> is not surprising when one considers the matter carefully. From the suttas it can be seen that, although <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> as a ‘technical’ term only refers to consciousness or awareness, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> devoid of other mental factors is merely a theoretical construct which in actual experience does not occur. Thus <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>, even in its broadest sense, is implied by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Feeling, perception and consciousness, friend—these states are conjoined (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsaṭṭhā</span>), not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states from the others in order to describe the difference between them.

<p>So whenever there is consciousness, the other mental factors will also be present (cf. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">MN 111</span></a>), and thus <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> is in effect no different from <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Citta</span> in turn cannot exist without <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>: mind without consciousness is surely an unintelligible concept.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 1.49</span></a> we find the following oft-quoted passage: ‘this mind (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cittaṁ</span>), bhikkhus, is radiant (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhassaraṁ</span>), but is defiled by defilements which arrive’. Might this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhassara citta</span> be an eternal, radiant, and pure mind? It seems clear from the following that this cannot be the case:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>So too, bhikkhus, there are these five corruptions of the mind (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cittassa</span>), corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhassaraṁ</span>) but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints.

<p>This appears to be the only unambiguous usage of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhassara</span> in the suttas.

<p>8. Does the Term Citta Have Two Fundamentally Distinct Referents?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If, as suggested by <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, one sees the Nikāyas as including a doctrine of two fundamentally different types of consciousness, i.e. a Samsāric consciousness and a timeless Nibbānic consciousness, then, in view of the close relationship between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>, one would expect the Nikāyas to make a similar distinction between two fundamentally different types of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>. Thus the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> would sometimes refer to the ordinary <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puthujjana</span> and at other times refer to a permanent <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> known to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> A phrase such as ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cittaṁ vimuccati</span>’ (e.g. at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">MN 51:27.2</span></a>), ‘the mind is liberated’, would then refer to the liberated ‘eternal mind’, or ‘original pure mind’, known to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But there is no evidence to support making this distinction. Nowhere in the suttas do we find that two such different realities could both be referred to as ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>’. Considering the centrality of this issue for the proper understanding of the Dhamma, it seems highly unlikely that the Buddha should have used the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> in such distinct ways without clearly commenting upon it.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In my opinion, the only possible meaning of such phrases as ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cittaṁ vimuccati</span>’ is that the ‘ordinary’ mind is liberated from the defilements (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āsavā</span>). There is no indication that this mind is somehow permanent. Indeed, one would have expected <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> to be used synonymously with Nibbāna if this thesis were correct.

<p><span id="chapter10" class="anchor"></span>10. Final Nibbāna</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discussion so far has emphasised that, according to the Nikāyas, final Nibbāna cannot be regarded as some sort of permanent or timeless consciousness or mind and that it cannot be regarded as a self (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span>). But highlighting what final Nibbāna <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>is not obviously begs the question: What then is final Nibbāna?

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Before I attempt to answer this question, it is necessary to investigate a number of sutta passages that concern Nibbāna more directly. These passages are often referred to as evidence that final Nibbāna is some sort of ‘state’<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> (see for instance <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Bodhi 2005</span>, p.318).<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a> But I would contend that they do not need to be interpreted in this way.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Sometimes Nibbāna is called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbānadhātu</span>, e.g. at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 45.7:2.4</span></a>.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> The word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span> is often translated as ‘element’. Basing one’s understanding on this translation it is natural to conclude that Nibbāna must be ‘something’.

Again, it seems natural to identify this with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The final line of the verse, ‘just this is the end of suffering’, would normally refer to the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. ‘Just this is the end of suffering’, or more commonly ‘the end of suffering’, is a standard way of describing the attainment of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship, e.g. at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">MN 144:11.3–11.9</span></a>. In sum, the above passage at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Ud 8.1:3.1–3.4</span></a> seems to describe something related to both <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariya samādhi</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. It seems clear therefore that it must relate to Nibbāna, with final Nibbāna perhaps being the most likely candidate.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a> But even if this is the case, the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span>, like the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span>, is used so broadly in the Nikāyas that this would still not be decisive in showing that final Nibbāna is a ‘state’.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>None of the passages discussed in this section need be read as descriptions of final Nibbāna, let alone as final Nibbāna being ‘something’ in a positive sense. Indeed, it may be that the standard practice of leaving Nibbāna untranslated prejudices our perception of this concept, giving it a sense of a real existing entity when in fact this may not be warranted.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-Chapter">
<p>11. Might Final Nibbāna be an ‘Existing Entity’ Entirely Different from the Five Khandhas?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reason why the above analysis has not produced any decisive result regarding the nature of final Nibbāna is simply that the suttas very rarely seem to speak of final Nibbāna; their emphasis is on Nibbāna during life, the experience of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. Nevertheless, we have seen that final Nibbāna cannot be equated with a form of consciousness or mind. Indeed, it is clear that it must be other than the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>. This being the case, could final Nibbāna be a ‘state’, some sort of ‘existing entity’, quite separate from the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The idea that final Nibbāna is an ‘existing entity’ is usually matched with the idea that this ‘state’ can be experienced while the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> is still alive.<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a> In fact, these two ideas of necessity go together: if the final Nibbāna ‘state’ was not experienceable by living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahants</span>, they would not know of its existence and consequently there could be no record of it for posterity. But the idea that final Nibbāna <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>can be experienced by the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> is doctrinally problematic. An experience of something—without which one cannot know that it exists—by definition includes consciousness. Thus, an experience of the equivalent of final Nibbāna while alive must involve consciousness. Indeed, this is also the standard explanation for how Nibbāna is said to be experienced: the mind or consciousness takes it as its object.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The problem with this idea is that it does not fit the Nikāyas’ explanation of consciousness. As I have already pointed out in the introduction to this paper, consciousness is always defined by the object it takes and thus there are precisely six classes of consciousness, one for each of the five senses and one for the mind (e.g. at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 22.57:14.1–14.4</span></a>). There is no indication anywhere of any further classes of consciousness. Yet the idea of final Nibbāna as an object of consciousness would require a seventh class of consciousness: it does not fit into any of the six classes mentioned in the suttas.<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a> Thus, to see consciousness as taking final Nibbāna as its object is to go beyond fixed sutta categories and therefore a baseless extension of what appears to be a full description of reality in the Nikāyas.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>More generally, is it sensible to speak of a final Nibbāna ‘state’ that is entirely other than the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>? If consciousness ceases once and for all, what could final Nibbāna possibly be? It makes no sense to speak of a ‘state’ which by definition cannot be known. Such a state becomes a mere cipher, something completely devoid of meaning. It is tantamount to not existing at all.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>That the idea of final Nibbāna being a ‘state’ is a weak one, is also clear from the principle of Occam’s razor. This philosophical principle states that ‘the fewest possible assumptions are to be made in explaining things’.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a> In the present case, all ideas of final Nibbāna being an ‘existing reality’ produce complications—and therefore a need for further assumptions<a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>—that make these ideas less compelling according to Occam’s razor. The simplest explanation of what happens at final Nibbāna is simply that the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> cease. The simplicity and directness of this idea and its fit, as I have tried to show, with all aspects of the teachings found in the Nikāyas, makes it by far the strongest candidate for explaining final Nibbāna.<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Finally, I wish to point out one remaining danger with insisting that final Nibbāna is a ‘state’ of ‘something’. For a <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puthujjana</span> such a ‘state’ would be quite literally unimaginable.<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a> In trying to understand it, he would quite naturally employ some version of the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>. Anyone who accepts the Buddha’s teaching that final Nibbāna is the highest happiness would therefore almost unavoidably grasp at or attach to that version of the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>. Because the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> can manifest in extremely subtle ways—for instance, for anyone who has not experienced it, it would be virtually impossible to imagine what the experience of the base of nothingness is like—one would quite likely not even be aware of one’s attachment. In this way one ends up grasping the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>—that is, grasping what is in reality suffering—thinking it to be final Nibbāna. And instead of reaching final Nibbāna one ends up perpetuating <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>. The view that final Nibbāna is just cessation is thus not only the one that seems most in tune with the Nikāyas but also the one that quite pragmatically is most likely to lead to an exit from <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a></p>

<p>By asking ‘is there anything else?’ and ‘is there not anything else?’ the questioner reveals his distorted outlook, his preoccupation and concern about the fate of his non-existing self.<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a> This is why Sāriputta calls the questions <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">papañca</span>, ‘proliferation’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">papañca</span> being the distorted thinking process that arises from a distorted perception of reality.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puthujjana</span> is trapped by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sakkāyadiṭṭhi</span>, by the perception of a permanent core in himself. But from his own point of view, whether he is aware of it or not, he is simply concerned with the destiny of what he sees as his own true essence.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But if the illusion of personal identity is seen through, if the perceived solid core is seen not to exist, there is nothing to be concerned about any more.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a> When it is seen that all a being is made up of are the ever-impermanent <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>, utterly tied up with suffering, then cessation becomes the most desirable thing possible.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the final analysis, the Buddha’s teachings concern only the ending of suffering. Although it seems clear that ‘mere’ cessation is the correct interpretation of final Nibbāna and although there are obvious dangers in regarding final Nibbāna as ‘something’, ultimately it is irrelevant whether the state that supervenes when the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> dies is ‘something’ or ‘nothing’. All that matters is that the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>—that is, suffering—cease without remainder. Consider how the Buddha sometimes would summarise his teachings: ‘Good, good, Anurādha. Formerly, Anurādha, and also now, I make known just suffering and the cessation of suffering’ (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 22.86:13.1–13.2</span></a>).<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a> And since suffering is coterminous with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, it follows that ‘Nibbāna is the greatest bliss’ (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">MN 75:21.5</span></a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Dhp 204</span></a>).

<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> This would thus include the actual event of becoming an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. As pointed out by <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, p.183, at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 38.1:2.3–2.4</span></a> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship is explicitly defined as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion. This shows the close relationship between Nibbāna and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship in general. Harvey tries to show at some length that Nibbāna here refers to the event of attaining <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship, not an aspect of the general state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. His first argument is that the Pali terminology points to an event rather than an ongoing reality. Without going into detail, it seems to me that the terminology is open to either interpretation, but most likely it refers to both. His second and main argument is based on the fact that Nibbāna is the end of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dukkha</span> whereas the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> still has some <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dukkha</span> remaining and thus the general state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship cannot be called Nibbāna. But Nibbāna at <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship is called Nibbāna ‘with residue remaining’ <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Iti 44:3.1–3.5</span></a>, the residue being the experience of ‘what is agreeable and disagreeable … pleasure and pain (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dukkha</span>)’. It seems clear enough, therefore, that the presence of a residue of suffering does not bar the absence of lust, hatred and delusion in an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> from being called Nibbāna.</p>

<li id="fn7"><div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> The literal meaning of Nibbāna is ‘extinguishment’. (Alternatively, Nibbāna could perhaps be translated as ‘extinction’. However, ‘extinction’ has such negative connotations in English—connotations that obviously do not pertain to Nibbāna—that ‘extinguishment’ seems more appropriate). Nibbāna as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion is therefore simply the permanent extinguishing of these three defilements. In fact, Nibbāna is a relative term in the suttas, its precise connotation depending on what is being extinguished. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 9.47</span></a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 9.48</span></a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 9.49</span></a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 9.50</span></a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 9.51</span></a> each jhāna and each immaterial attainment is said to be ‘provisional Nibbāna (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbānaṁ … pariyāyena</span>)’. ‘Non-provisional Nibbāna’ is reached at <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship, and ‘final Nibbāna’ at the death of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> (see below). In each case something is extinguished (either temporarily or permanently): in first jhāna the five hindrances and the five senses are temporarily extinguished, in the second jhāna <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vitakkavicāra</span> etc.. At final Nibbāna all five aggregates are permanently extinguished.</p>

<li id="fn12"><div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> For instance in the Para­mat­tha­dīpanī­ṭīkā: <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">‘evaṁ suññatādināmaṁ nibbānaṁ ārammaṇaṁ katvā pavattāni maggaphalānipi ārammaṇavasenapi suññatādināmaṁ labhati’</span>, ‘Thus having made Nibbāna, which is called “emptiness” etc., the object, the resulting path and fruit obtain the name “emptiness” etc. on account of the object’. It is noteworthy that this statement is found in a modern (19th century) commentarial work. In his translation and explanation of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhammattha Saṅgaha</span>, in which he refers extensively to the above mentioned <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ṭīkā</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Bodhi 1993</span>, p.363 states that: ‘the attainment of fruition (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">phalasamāpatti</span>) is a meditative attainment by which a noble disciple enters into supramundane absorption with Nibbāna as object’.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>It is difficult to ascertain with any precision when the idea of Nibbāna as an object of consciousness first appears in Pali literature. It might be claimed that it appears already in the Canonical <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span> where the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">asaṅkhatadhātu</span> is included in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhammāyatana</span> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/vb2/en/thittila?reference=main/pts&amp;highlight=false#pts-vp-pli72"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Vibh 72</span></a>). However, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">asaṅkhatadhātu</span> is then defined in exactly the same way as in the suttas, namely, as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/vb2/en/thittila?reference=main/pts&amp;highlight=false#pts-vp-pli73"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Vibh 73</span></a>). There is no indication that Nibbāna is an ‘existing entity’ which is taken as a direct object of consciousness. Exactly how the commentaries understand Nibbāna is also a moot point. I am not able to discuss this here, since it would be a major study in itself to trace the historical development of how Nibbāna is understood in Pali literature.</p>
</div>
<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></li>
<li id="fn13"><div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> Nibbāna cannot simply be classified as a mind object—with the corresponding consciousness being mind-consciousness—since all mind objects and their corresponding objects are said to be impermanent and suffering; see e.g. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 35.32</span></a>. Indeed, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Salāyatana Saṁyutta</span> contains a large number of suttas that directly state that mental phenomena (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhammas</span>) are suffering. These statements often have an almost equational quality. And there is no clear statement anywhere in the suttas that there are any exceptions to this. In fact the six senses together with their six objects are called ‘the all’ (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 35.23</span></a>), clearly indicating that there are no further senses or sense objects apart from these. These statements taken together make it impossible, to my mind, to accept the idea of Nibbāna as a mind object cognised by mind-consciousness. (The post-canonical literature, however, sometimes seems to take a different position, see e.g. the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Milindapañha</span>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mil6.2.5/en/tw_rhysdavids"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Mil 6.2.5</span></a>).</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> Deep states of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>, in particular the jhānas, consist of completely stable and uninterrupted perceptions, until one emerges.</p>

<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></li>
<li id="fn15"><div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> This interpretation hinges on understanding <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ</span> to be an equational sentence: ‘the cessation of existence is Nibbāna’. On this reading, the expression is clearly an idea about Nibbāna, not a direct reference to it. If instead one were to translate this phrase as two words in apposition, ‘the cessation of existence, Nibbāna’, then this would be a direct reference to Nibbāna and one would have to conclude that the phrase concerns a direct perception of Nibbāna. There are other suttas (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 3.32</span></a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 10.6</span></a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 11.7</span></a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 11.8</span></a>), however, that speak of the same sort of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> but whose interpretation is unambiguous. In these suttas the relevant perception is given as ‘this is peaceful, this is sublime, that is … Nibbāna (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">etaṁ santaṁ, etaṁ paṇītaṁ, yad idaṁ … nibbānan ti</span>)’. Here the wording is such—i.e. the verb ‘to be’ is required—that there can be no doubt that we are dealing with a sentence not just words in apposition. It seems quite clear, therefore, that this concerns a perception of an idea, an idea about Nibbāna—i.e. ‘this is peaceful, this is sublime’—not a direct experience of Nibbāna. From this it is necessary to conclude that the expression <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ</span> should also be understood as a sentence, not just two words in apposition.</p>

Harvey does not in fact use the words ‘permanent consciousness’ in describing final Nibbāna. Instead, he says final Nibbāna is a ‘stopped discernment’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, p.201; ‘discernment’ being Harvey’s translation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>) or ‘consciousness beyond time’ (p.208). (He also argues that this ‘timeless’ Nibbāna can be periodically experienced by the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> during life, p.208). But the idea that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nirodha</span> can be understood as a ‘stopped state’ rather than just ‘cessation’ is not supported by the use of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nirodha</span> in the Nikāyas. Wherever its meaning is unambiguous it means ‘ending’, ‘cessation’; there is never any sense that it refers to a ‘state’. To make his point Harvey also employs the double meaning in English of the word ‘stopped’. For him a ‘stopped discernment’ is thus a consciousness that stands still, continuing without change, not a consciousness that has ended. In Pali, however, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nirodha</span>/<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">niruddha</span> has no such double meaning, it only means ‘stopped’ as in ‘ceased’ or ‘ended’.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>As for Harvey’s use of the phrase ‘consciousness beyond time’, as opposed to ‘permanent consciousness’, it is difficult to see that it makes any difference. As a general tool of interpretation, it seems clear that the Nikāyas cannot possibly refute every single formulation that constitutes a contradiction to their outlook. In many cases, such as the present one, one has to make reasonable assumptions as to the implications of the suttas’ statements. As far as I can see, a consciousness beyond time would for all practical purposes be the same as a permanent consciousness, since it is change that gives rise to a perception of time. Moreover, since Nibbāna is specifically said to be <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhuva</span>, ‘stable’ (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 43.20</span></a>), which in the suttas is used as a synonym for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nicca</span>, ‘permanent’, the idea of ‘consciousness beyond time’ as opposed to ‘permanent consciousness’ seems to be a red herring.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>An interesting passage in this context is found at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">DN 15:27.1–32.11</span></a>. Here the Buddha asks the following semi-rhetorical question: ‘Where nothing at all is felt, could there be any sense of “I am” with reference to that (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tattha</span>)?’ (DN 15:30.3). From the subsequent conversation it is clear that the correct answer is ‘no’ and therefore that such a ‘state’ cannot be regarded as a self.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, p.31 seems to interpret this to mean that if there is no experience of ‘I am’ at the time one abides in a particular state, i.e. that there is no self-awareness in that state, then that is sufficient to show that that state cannot be regarded as a permanent self. If this were correct, then any deep state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>, during which there is no perception ‘I am’, could also not be taken as a self. Yet, as I have argued above, it is perfectly possible to regard such states as an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span> once one emerges from them.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>But the passage at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">DN 15:27.1–32.11</span></a> does not have to be interpreted as Harvey does. Its interpretation hinges on the import of the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tattha</span>, which Harvey translates as ‘there’. But, as is implied in my translation above, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tattha</span> frequently has a ‘locative’ sense, meaning ‘in this case’, ‘about this’, ‘with reference to this’. If this is the intended meaning also in the present case, then the passage means there can be no sense of ‘I am’ with reference to that state. In other words, one is incapable of taking that state as a permanent self even after one emerges from it, which is precisely what one would expect of a ‘state’ where nothing at all is felt, where nothing at all is experienced.</p>

<p>Harvey’s translation, ‘non-manifestive’, by which he means that nothing can ‘appear on or in’ this consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, p. 206), in my opinion stretches the meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> beyond what is reasonable. At the very least such a meaning would require a causative construction and probably something more involved (e.g. ‘the consciousness with which nothing else manifests’), not just the simple adjective.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>Harvey supports his understanding by referring to a passage at MN 21:14.8–14.9 where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span>, together with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arūpī</span>, is used to describe space: no picture can be drawn ‘on’ space (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ākāsa</span>) since it is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arūpī</span>.

<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> I take ‘long and short, small and great, fair and foul’ to be poetic examples of ‘name-and-form’ and thus to be included within name-and-form.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>It is significant that the Chinese version of these verses (at T I 102c, 14–19) supports the above analysis. The question verse of the Chinese is virtually identical with the question verse of the Pali. (In both versions, this verse is the Buddha’s reformulation of the original single question into two questions.) The answer verse is as follows: ‘one should answer (應答): “Consciousness without form (識無形); infinite, self-illuminating (無量自有光); when this ceases then the four great [elements] cease (此滅四大滅); gross, subtle, beautiful, ugly cease (麤細好醜滅滅); therefore name-and-form cease (於此名色滅); consciousness ceases, remainder also ceases (識滅餘亦滅)”‘. Here it is quite clear that we have two answers. The first one is ‘consciousness without form, infinite, self-illuminating’. This would then be the answer to the first question about where the four elements cease or find no footing. Since the second line begins ‘when this ceases …’, ‘this’ presumably referring back to the consciousness without form of the previous line (it is difficult to see what else it might refer to), this must be a second answer. This answer would correspond to the second question, concerning where name and form wholly cease. (Admittedly, the Chinese is a bit confusing here, since it starts the second answer with ‘then the four great elements cease’. I take this mention of the four great elements as simply an elaboration on some of the aspects of name-and-form.) Moreover, it is clear in the Chinese that the ‘consciousness without form’ cannot be a reference to Nibbāna since it ceases together with all other phenomena.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> There are, in fact, good reasons for questioning whether this passage should be included in our analysis at all, since the reading in the above <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">MN 49:25.1</span></a> quote is very uncertain. According to the Burmese version of this verse, it is the Buddha who speaks it, referring to his own special understanding. However, according to the Sri Lankan, the Thai, and the PTS versions of this verse, it is spoken by Baka the Brahmā, referring to his special understanding (see <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Anālayo 2011</span>, footnote 162 to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">MN 49</span></a>). This is obviously highly significant, because if this refers to Baka the Brahmā’s knowledge, then <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana viññāṇa</span> must refer to a state of consciousness that he can access, i.e. most likely a jhāna state. This interpretation is further reinforced by the Chinese version of this sutta, also according to which it was Brahmā who spoke, see T I 548b, 11. (It is also significant that in the Chinese there is no equivalent of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span>.) Given this uncertainty in the reading, it would be quite reasonable, maybe even preferable, to leave the passage at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">MN 49:25.1</span></a> out of the present discussion.

<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>A similar position seems to be taken in <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Mahā Boowa 1980</span>, p.23: ‘the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> by its very nature is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">amataṁ</span> - Undying …’; ‘Once <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paññā</span> has totally shattered and cleared the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kilesas</span> away, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> will be transformed into the state of purity … How can it vanish? … this one is the genuine <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">amataṁ</span> (the Undying).

It cannot be annihilated’ (76). It must be kept in mind, however, that the teachings given by Thai meditation teachers are often difficult to interpret. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, the idiom of Thai meditation teachers, particularly those associated with the Thai forest tradition, is notoriously idiosyncratic. They rarely use the expressions and words found in the Nikāyas, and if they do, they sometimes give these expressions new meanings. Secondly, the language they use is often not very precise, at least compared with that of the suttas, and thus there are significant problems of interpretation. Thus it is possible that Ven. Ajahn Mahā Boowa may be referring to something other than the English translation appears to show. Still, the translation as it stands is hard to square with the descriptions of Nibbāna and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> in the suttas.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> They are beside the point only in so far as it is cessation that is the true goal. A debate about final Nibbāna is still useful to the extent that it makes this clear. And, given the discussion so far, it is useful for pointing out that postulating anything additional to mere cessation does not make good sense and for showing that seeing final Nibbāna as a ‘state’ may prove obstructive to achieving one’s goal. The concern over ‘is there not anything else?’ relates to annihilationism (again, see Mp III 150, 15), and I have argued that cessation is different from the annihilation of a permanent self.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> This passage is almost as explicit as can be that there is nothing apart from <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dukkha</span> and its cessation.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>It is sometimes argued that the Buddha never speaks of final Nibbāna as just cessation <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Bodhi 2005</span>, p.319. (Ven. Bodhi in fact uses the word ‘nonexistence’ rather than cessation. Although the term nonexistence is unfortunate since it implies something as existing prior to final Nibbāna—see <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">SN 12.15:2.1–2.3</span></a> where the ideas of existence and nonexistence, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">atthitañ</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">natthitañ</span>, are presented as false—it seems to me that Ven. Bodhi actually means nonexistence in the sense of (mere) cessation.) But on a number of occasions the Buddha uses terminology that it seems should be understood in just this way, for instance at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">MN 140:24.5</span></a>: ‘on the dissolution of the body, with the ending of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here’. At the same time it is hardly surprising that the Buddha should not spend too much time proclaiming that the nature of final Nibbāna is just cessation. Such statements are bound to be misunderstood by the vast majority of people because of their sense of a permanent self (the Buddha is in fact disparaged as an annihilationist in the suttas on a number of occasions, for instance at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">AN 8.11:6.1</span></a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">MN 22:37.2</span></a>), and thus it would be counterproductive to teach the Dhamma in this way. It seems that the relative paucity of statements on the nature of final Nibbāna is simply a result of the Buddha being pragmatic as to what teachings would inspire the majority of people who are not <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariyas</span>, whether monastic or lay.</p>
