<p>Introduction</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is the goal of Buddhist practice. As such it is only natural that there is great interest in understanding what it might mean to achieve it. At the same time, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is the most profound of Buddhist concepts. It is perhaps not surprising then that the concept of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> has given rise to a large number of interpretations, some based on meditative experience and others on scriptural study and ‘logical’ deduction, and that many of them are mutually contradictory.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Given this confusing situation, the purpose of the present paper is to try to pin down what the Buddha himself meant by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>. The only satisfactory way of achieving this is to turn to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>, for it is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> that are the final arbiter in any <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Dhamma</span> dispute:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Suppose a monk were to say: ‘… this is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhamma</span>, this is the discipline (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vinayo</span>), this is the Master’s teaching’, then, monks, you should neither approve nor disapprove his words. Then, without approving or disapproving, his words and expressions should be carefully noted and compared with the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> and reviewed in light of the discipline. If they, on such comparison and review, are found not to conform to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is not the word of the Buddha, it has been wrongly understood by this monk’, and the matter is to be rejected. But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha, it has been rightly understood by this monk.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the following discussion on the nature of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> I will therefore base my argument, as far as possible, on the complete contents of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> More specifically, I will inquire into the relationship between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> on the one hand and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> on the other. An understanding of this relationship, as I intend to show, is critical for a proper understanding of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>. In the final section of this paper, I will discuss <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> itself in greater detail. But to prepare the ground for the ensuing discussion, it is necessary first of all to take a preliminary look at how the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> employ the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-Chapter">
<p>1. An Initial Investigation into the Referents of the term Nibbāna</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There are three frequently mentioned referents of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>:</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion upon the attainment of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship;</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as the ‘state’ that occurs after the death of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>; and</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>as the object of consciousness in a special kind of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I will briefly discuss each one of these in turn.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-space">
<p>0</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>1) Whenever <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is defined in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>, it is always in the same way:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>‘The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this, friend, is called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>’.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is sometimes argued that this ‘destruction’ only refers to the actual event of becoming an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> (<span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, pp.182–185). However, since the destruction is permanent it would seem more likely that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> here refers to the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion as a general and fundamental characteristic of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Moreover, the event of becoming an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>, that is the final destruction of the defilements, is presumably instantaneous: either one is an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> or one is not. But the narrow focus on momentary events, usually known as mind moments, is a characteristic of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhidhamma</span> and later Pali literature, not the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> normally refer to realities that are extended in time. That this is the case also for the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> attained at <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship is clear from the following passages:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When lust is abandoned (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rāge</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pahīne</span>) … when hatred is abandoned … when delusion is abandoned one does not intend for one’s own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both and one does not experience mental pain and dejection. It is in this way, brahmin, that <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Nibbāna</span> is visible in this very life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">
<p><em>(transl. Brahmāli)</em><br />
AN 3.55:2.2–2.3</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Not intending for one’s own or others’ affliction, and not experiencing mental pain and dejection, cannot be momentary. Nor can <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> be momentary in the following description:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what, monks, is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> element with residue remaining? Here, a monk is an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge. However, his five senses remain unimpaired, by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable, still feels pleasure and pain. It is the destruction of lust, hatred, and delusion in him that is called the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> element with residue remaining.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">
<p>Iti 44:3.1–3.5</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Thus I take <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> in the above definition to refer to that unchanging and permanent aspect of the general state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship which is the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion.<span id="footnote7" class="anchor"></span><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> In this sense <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is an everpresent reality for the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Moreover, since the destruction of the three root defilements is the standard <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāya</span> explanation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>, it seems reasonable to assume that whenever <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is used without further qualification it refers to this aspect of the state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. This will be my assumption throughout this paper.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-space">
<p>0</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>2) Occasionally <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is used to describe the ‘state’ that occurs after the death of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what, monks, is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> element without residue remaining?

For him, here in this very life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here [i.e. at death]. That, monks, is called the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> element without residue remaining.</p>

<p>This <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> is sometimes said to take <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as its ‘object’,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> i.e. taking the equivalent of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as its object. However, I cannot see how this explanation can be correct. Final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> by definition is other than <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, which means it is other than the six sense bases and their six corresponding classes of objects. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span>, consciousness is always defined by the object it takes and consequently there are precisely six classes of consciousness. For <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> to be an object of consciousness, an entirely new class of consciousness would be required, going beyond the established <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāya</span> taxonomy.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Indeed, the above quote contains sufficient pointers to make it unlikely that this is a direct reference to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>. Firstly, perception is specifically said to be present. As in the case of consciousness, perception in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> is restricted to six classes, all of which are bound up with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> (SN 22.57:10.1–10.9). There is no room for a direct perception of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> in this system of classification. Secondly, the perceptions are said to arise and cease, one after the other. Arising and ceasing is a characteristic of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, not <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>: <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is specifically said to be stable (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhuva</span>; SN 43.20). One would expect a <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> that takes <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as its object to be stable, much like the stability of perception found in other deep states of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>I would therefore propose an alternative interpretation of this passage.

<p>Of these three referents of the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>, the first one is relatively straight-forward: it refers to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant’s</span> state of having extinguished all defilements.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> In <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāya</span> usage this is the usual meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>.

<p>It is not uncommon to come across attempts to justify the existence of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span> (in the sense of a permanent self) using the Buddha’s teachings and the claim that the end of the Buddhist path is the freeing of this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span> from suffering.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> But the evidence quoted to support such claims is often weak, and it frequently relies on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sutta</span> quotes whose interpretation is difficult.</p>

<p>MN 49:25.1</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It has been suggested that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> refers to a state of consciousness that is equivalent to final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> (e.g. Harvey 1995, p.201),40 but in light of the discussion of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> in the previous section, such an interpretation is untenable. However, to establish the correct interpretation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> is far from easy. Firstly, in the whole Pali Canon the expression <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> only appears in the above two passages.41 Secondly, Pali verse is notoriously difficult to translate: the correct Pali reading is often difficult to establish and poetic licence etc. can complicate matters further.42 Moreover, as in poetry in general, the exact meaning of Pali verse is often vague as its emphasis is on appealing to emotion and intuition rather than on making precise doctrinal statements.43 Finally, Pali verse often contains rare words and phrases that sometimes occur nowhere else in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tipiṭaka</span>.44</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, and to show that there are other interpretations of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> that are just as good as or even better than that of a permanent consciousness, I shall put forward an alternative interpretation. To this end, it is necessary to analyse the above quotes in more detail.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The first thing to note is that, due to the qualifiers <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ananta</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhā</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> is described in a way that resembles the description of certain states of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Ananta</span> is closely connected to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>, and it is specifically used in the standard description of the first two immaterial attainments.45 Equally important is that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appamāṇa</span>, ‘immeasurable’, which is semantically very close to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ananta</span>,46 is very frequently connected with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. In particular, it is used in the standard passage on the divine abidings (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">brahma</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">-</span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vihāras</span>; e.g. at MN 7:13.1, 16.1), but it is also employed as a general qualifier of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.47 As for the second qualifier, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhā</span>, it does not seem to be used elsewhere to directly qualify <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. However, the closely related term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhassara</span>, ‘shining’, is often used to describe the mind without hindrances (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nīvaraṇa</span>), the most obvious example of which is the mind in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.48 Thus, given the usage of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ananta</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhā</span> in the above quotes, it seems plausible, perhaps even likely, that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> refers to a state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Next, it is necessary to look more carefully at the structure of the above verses. For the present purposes, an important fact which is rarely pointed out is that the first verse (the ‘question verse’) in the above DN 11:85.11–85.27 passage seems to contain two questions rather than one.49 When we turn to the second verse (the ‘answer verse’), it seems that we are again dealing with two separate answers: otherwise there would be a contradiction between the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> with various attributes described in the first line and the cessation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> described in the last line – consciousness cannot be described as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anantaṁ</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabbato</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pabhaṁ</span> and at the same time be said to have ceased. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that the first line of the question verse is answered by the first two lines of the answer verse, and the last two lines of the question verse are answered by the last three lines of the answer verse.50 If this structural analysis is accepted, then it becomes clear that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> is simply a form of consciousness where ‘earth, water, fire and air find no footing’;51 it is not related to the cessation of name-and-form.52</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>At this point we must consider the second passage quoted above (MN 49:25.1). The wider context of this verse makes it clear that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> is ‘not commensurate with the allness of all’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabbassa</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabbattena</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ananubhūtaṁ</span>), that is, not the same nature as ‘all’. If ‘all’ here is to be understood as ‘all of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>’, then <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> must be based on an awareness or knowledge of ‘what’ lies beyond <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.53 In other words, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> must refer to a state of consciousness, perhaps a form of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>, possessed by a person who has an ‘outsider’s’ perspective on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, one who has seen the potential for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> to cease.54 This potential is only known to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariyas</span>.55</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Given the above analysis, we are now in a position to be quite specific in our understanding of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>. We have seen that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> is:</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In sum, it may never be possible to pin down the exact meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> with perfect certainty. However, given the broader message of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> concerning <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>, and given that there is at least one solid explanation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> which does not contradict this broader message, one is forced to reject the idea that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> is equivalent to the state of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>in the form of a permanent (or ‘timeless’) consciousness.58</p>

<p>5. Appatiṭṭhita Viññāṇa, Unestablished Consciousness</p>

In this way final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is again seen as a ‘state’ of consciousness (see in particular Harvey 1995, pp.201–203).59 The following three sutta passages are sometimes used to support this assertion:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>‘If, bhikkhus, there is no lust for the nutriment edible food, or for the nutriment contact, or for the nutriment mental volition, or for the nutriment consciousness, if there is no delight, if there is no craving, consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇaṁ</span>) does not become established (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhitaṁ</span>) there and come to growth … Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a house or hall with a peaked roof, with windows on the northern, southern, and eastern sides.

<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">
<p>SN 4.23:10.6</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the first quote above (SN 12.64:6.1–8.8), there is no good reason why <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> should be understood as referring to final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>. Consciousness is said to be unestablished ‘if there is no delight, if there is no craving’. The reference to absence of craving seems to make it fairly straightforward that this concerns the ordinary consciousness of the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>.60</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The second passage (SN 12.38:3.1–3.5) concerns a person who ‘does not intend’, ‘does not plan’, and ‘does not have a tendency towards anything’. His consciousness is then unestablished and ‘there is no descent of name-and-form’. If, as seems likely, descent of name-and-form refers to future rebirth, then the unestablished consciousness must refer to the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. Indeed, the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">suttas</span> immediately preceding and following this one, which are direct parallels to it, explicitly mention ‘future rebirth’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatiṁ</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">punabbhavābhinibbatti</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatiṁ</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">jāti</span> respectively) where the present <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sutta</span> mentions descent of name-and-form. This leaves little doubt that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> also in the present <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sutta</span> refers to the consciousness of the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. Moreover, the expression ‘when consciousness is unestablished … there is no descent of name-and-form’ seems to indicate that this concerns consciousness in general, not a specific state. thus, again, this seems to be a reference to an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">’s</span> general state of consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The third passage (SN 4.23:10.6) is more ambiguous, but it can easily be understood to mean that Godhika’s consciousness was unestablished at the time of death. In other words, there is no need to bring in any theory of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> consciousness that, in my opinion, clearly contradicts the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>’ general message on the subject.61</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Finally, there are still other passages in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> clearly refers to the general consciousness of the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>:</p>

<p>6. Could Citta (Mind) be a Referent of Final Nibbāna?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Is it reasonable, as is sometimes done, to use the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> (mind), or a particular state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>, as a synonym for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>?64 There is no clear evidence in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> ever being used in this way and, as I shall now try to show, the evidence to the contrary is compelling.</p>

<p>Feeling, perception and consciousness, friend—these states are conjoined (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsaṭṭhā</span>), not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states from the others in order to describe the difference between them.

<p>8. Does the Term Citta Have Two Fundamentally Distinct Referents?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If, as suggested by Harvey 1995, one sees the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span> as including a doctrine of two fundamentally different types of consciousness, i.e. a <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samsāric</span> consciousness and a timeless <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbānic</span> consciousness, then, in view of the close relationship between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>, one would expect the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span> to make a similar distinction between two fundamentally different types of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>. Thus the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> would sometimes refer to the ordinary <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puthujjana</span> and at other times refer to a permanent <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> known to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>.76 A phrase such as ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cittaṁ</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vimuccati</span>’ (e.g. at MN 51:27.2), ‘the mind is liberated’, would then refer to the liberated ‘eternal mind’, or ‘original pure mind’, known to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>.77</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But there is no evidence to support making this distinction. Nowhere in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> do we find that two such different realities could both be referred to as ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>’. Considering the centrality of this issue for the proper understanding of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Dhamma</span>, it seems highly unlikely that the Buddha should have used the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> in such distinct ways without clearly commenting upon it.78</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In my opinion, the only possible meaning of such phrases as ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cittaṁ</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vimuccati</span>’ is that the ‘ordinary’ mind is liberated from the defilements (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āsavā</span>). There is no indication that this mind is somehow permanent. Indeed, one would have expected <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> to be used synonymously with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> if this thesis were correct.

<p>10. Final Nibbāna</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discussion so far has emphasised that, according to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span>, final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> cannot be regarded as some sort of permanent or timeless consciousness or mind and that it cannot be regarded as a self (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span>). But highlighting what final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>is not obviously begs the question: What then is final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>? Indeed, it might be asked, is it anything at all apart from the cessation of existence?83</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Before I attempt to answer this question, it is necessary to investigate a number of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sutta</span> passages that concern <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> more directly. These passages are often referred to as evidence that final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is some sort of ‘state’84 (see for instance Bodhi 2005, p.318).85 But I would contend that they do not need to be interpreted in this way.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Sometimes <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbānadhātu</span>, e.g. at SN 45.7:2.4.86 The word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span> is often translated as ‘element’. Basing one’s understanding on this translation it is natural to conclude that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> must be ‘something’. However, this would be to ignore the range of meanings of the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span>.87 In addition to meaning ‘element’, it also has the sense of ‘property’ (see PED).88 This meaning is prominent in such compounds as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nirodha</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">-</span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span> (Iti 51:2.3), ‘the property of cessation’, and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nekkhamma</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">-</span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span> (SN 14.12:7.2), ‘the property of renunciation’.89 Indeed, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbānadhātu</span> itself is explained at SN 45.7:2.1–2.6, as nothing other than ‘the removal (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vinayo</span>) of lust, the removal of hatred and the removal of delusion’. Here, again, it is the property aspect which is to the fore, and the best translation would perhaps be ‘the property of extinguishment’.90</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another set of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>, at SN 43.12/SN 43.13/SN 43.14-43, present 32 synonyms for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>. This could easily be regarded as evidence of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as an existing ‘state’. However, in this case we need to be careful to distinguish between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as an aspect of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship (i.e. the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion) and final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>.

The initial phrase, ‘no coming … or reappearing’, elsewhere refers to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship (see Ud 8.4:3.5, MN 144:11.6–11.7 and cf. SN 12.40:1.5–1.6, 2.4–2.5, 3.4–3.5): there is no future coming, going, passing away, or reappearing for the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> as he has cut these things off. They cease here and now because their cause has been removed.94 That ‘unestablished’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span>, also refers to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship, I have already shown in the above section on ‘unestablished consciousness’. ‘Without basis’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anārammaṇa</span>,95 is often found together with ‘unestablished’ (SN 12.38, SN 12.39 &amp; SN 12.40) and would therefore also seem to refer to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. ‘Not moving’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appavatta</span>, does not seem to be encountered elsewhere in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span>, but it appears to be a simple reference to ‘not moving in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>’, being the opposite of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pavatta</span>, ‘moving on’/‘going on’. Again, it seems natural to identify this with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The final line of the verse, ‘just this is the end of suffering’, would normally refer to the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. ‘Just this is the end of suffering’, or more commonly ‘the end of suffering’, is a standard way of describing the attainment of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship, e.g. at MN 144:11.3–11.9. In sum, the above passage at Ud 8.1:3.1–3.4 seems to describe something related to both <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariya</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">-</span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. It seems clear therefore that it must relate to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>, with final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> perhaps being the most likely candidate.96 But even if this is the case, the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span>, like the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span>, is used so broadly in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span> that this would still not be decisive in showing that final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is a ‘state’. At AN 9.36, AN 9.43 and AN 9.44, for example, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> is used to describe <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saññāvedayitanirodha</span>, an attainment where the mental aggregates temporarily cease.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>What is here rendered as ‘freedom from what is born’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ajātaṁ</span>, is often translated as ‘the unborn’, giving a definite sense that this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sutta</span> describes something positively existing.97 However, as Johansson 1969, p.39, p.54) points out, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ajātaṁ</span> recurs at MN 26:18.1 where the context requires it to mean ‘freedom from birth’. Having understood that he is subject to birth, the Buddha-to-be seeks the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ajātaṁ</span>. If birth is a problem, then surely the natural thing to do is to seek a freedom from birth, not a ‘state’ that is unborn.98 The most reasonable translation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ajātaṁ</span>, therefore, would seem to be ‘freedom from what is born’ or ‘freedom from birth’.99 If this is accepted, it is natural to translate all the initial a’s at Ud 8.3:3.1–3.4 as privatives, that is, as ‘freedom from’. According to this interpretation (see my translation above), what is being described here is not necessarily a ‘state’ at all. In my opinion, all this passage does is to affirm the possibility of ending <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.100 Indeed, this is precisely the broader context of this extract.101</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>None of the passages discussed in this section need be read as descriptions of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>, let alone as final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> being ‘something’ in a positive sense. Indeed, it may be that the standard practice of leaving <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> untranslated prejudices our perception of this concept, giving it a sense of a real existing entity when in fact this may not be warranted. If instead we were to translate <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>in accordance with its meaning, perhaps with ‘extinguishment’,102 then our perception of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> would probably alter accordingly.103</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the end, the passages discussed in this section are not decisive in regard to the ontological status of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>.104 This brings us back to the question with which we started the present section: Is final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> anything at all apart from the cessation of existence?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-Chapter">
<p>11. Might Final Nibbāna be an ‘Existing Entity’ Entirely Different from the Five Khandhas?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reason why the above analysis has not produced any decisive result regarding the nature of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is simply that the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> very rarely seem to speak of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>; their emphasis is on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> during life, the experience of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. Nevertheless, we have seen that final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> cannot be equated with a form of consciousness or mind. Indeed, it is clear that it must be other than the five khandhas. This being the case, could final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> be a ‘state’, some sort of ‘existing entity’, quite separate from the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The idea that final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is an ‘existing entity’ is usually matched with the idea that this ‘state’ can be experienced while the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> is still alive.105 In fact, these two ideas of necessity go together: if the final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> ‘state’ was not experienceable by living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahants</span>, they would not know of its existence and consequently there could be no record of it for posterity. But the idea that final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>can be experienced by the living <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> is doctrinally problematic. An experience of something — without which one cannot know that it exists — by definition includes consciousness. Thus, an experience of the equivalent of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> while alive must involve consciousness. Indeed, this is also the standard explanation for how <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is said to be experienced: the mind or consciousness takes it as its object.106</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The problem with this idea is that it does not fit the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span>’ explanation of consciousness. As I have already pointed out in the introduction to this paper, consciousness is always defined by the object it takes and thus there are precisely six classes of consciousness, one for each of the five senses and one for the mind (e.g. at SN 22.57:14.1–14.4). There is no indication anywhere of any further classes of consciousness. Yet the idea of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as an object of consciousness would require a seventh class of consciousness: it does not fit into any of the six classes mentioned in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>.107 Thus, to see consciousness as taking final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as its object is to go beyond fixed sutta categories and therefore a baseless extension of what appears to be a full description of reality in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>More generally, is it sensible to speak of a final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> ‘state’ that is entirely other than the five khandhas? If consciousness ceases once and for all, what could final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> possibly be? It makes no sense to speak of a ‘state’ which by definition cannot be known. Such a state becomes a mere cipher, something completely devoid of meaning. It is tantamount to not existing at all.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>That the idea of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> being a ‘state’ is a weak one, is also clear from the principle of Occam’s razor. This philosophical principle states that ‘the fewest possible assumptions are to be made in explaining things’.108 In the present case, all ideas of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> being an ‘existing reality’ produce complications — and therefore a need for further assumptions109 — that make these ideas less compelling according to Occam’s razor. The simplest explanation of what happens at final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is simply that the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> cease. The simplicity and directness of this idea and its fit, as I have tried to show, with all aspects of the teachings found in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span>, makes it by far the strongest candidate for explaining final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>.110</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Finally, I wish to point out one remaining danger with insisting that final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is a ‘state’ of ‘something’. For a <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puthujjana</span> such a ‘state’ would be quite literally unimaginable.111 In trying to understand it, he would quite naturally employ some version of the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>. Anyone who accepts the Buddha’s teaching that final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is the highest happiness would therefore almost unavoidably grasp at or attach to that version of the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>. Because the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> can manifest in extremely subtle ways — for instance, for anyone who has not experienced it, it would be virtually impossible to imagine what the experience of the base of nothingness is like — one would quite likely not even be aware of one’s attachment. In this way one ends up grasping the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> — that is, grasping what is in reality suffering — thinking it to be final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>. And instead of reaching final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> one ends up perpetuating <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>. The view that final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is just cessation is thus not only the one that seems most in tune with the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span> but also the one that quite pragmatically is most likely to lead to an exit from <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.112</p>

From the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahants</span>’ point of view the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> have nothing to do with them;117 nor are they anything apart from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>, as we have seen in the Yamaka Sutta. Moreover, because the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> are suffering, their cessation can only be a good thing. The death of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> is just the end, the cessation, of an unwanted process.

If it seems bleak, it is only due to the false sense of having a permanent self, or more precisely, because of the view of personal identity, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sakkāya</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">-</span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">diṭṭhi</span>.122 The sense that one has a permanent core — a distortion of perception that is unavoidable for all <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puthujjanas</span> — makes cessation appear like annihilation and the successful practice of the path like a form of suicide. If cessation seems undesirable, it is only due to this distorted outlook.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Consider the following discussion between Ven. Sāriputta and Ven. Mahā-Koṭṭhita:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>[Mahā-Koṭṭhita:] ‘Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six spheres of sense contact (i.e. final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>), is there anything else? … is there not anything else?’ …</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>[Sāriputta:] ‘Speaking thus: “Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six spheres of sense contact, is there anything else? … is there not anything else?”, one proliferates (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">papañceti</span>) about that which is without proliferation (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appapañcaṁ</span>)’. (<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">transl. Brahmāli</span>)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-tight-right-cite">
<p>AN 4.173</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>By asking ‘is there anything else?’ and ‘is there not anything else?’ the questioner reveals his distorted outlook, his preoccupation and concern about the fate of his non-existing self.123 This is why Sāriputta calls the questions <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">papañca</span>, ‘proliferation’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">papañca</span> being the distorted thinking process that arises from a distorted perception of reality.124 The <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puthujjana</span> is trapped by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sakkāya</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">-</span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">diṭṭhi</span>, by the perception of a permanent core in himself. But from his own point of view, whether he is aware of it or not, he is simply concerned with the destiny of what he sees as his own true essence.125</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But if the illusion of personal identity is seen through, if the perceived solid core is seen not to exist, there is nothing to be concerned about anymore.126 When it is seen that all a being is made up of are the ever-impermanent <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>, utterly tied up with suffering, then cessation becomes the most desirable thing possible. Questions such as ‘is there anything else?’ and ‘is there not anything else?’ are quite simply beside the point.127</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the final analysis, the Buddha’s teachings concern only the ending of suffering. Although it seems clear that ‘mere’ cessation is the correct interpretation of final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> and although there are obvious dangers in regarding final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as ‘something’, ultimately it is irrelevant whether the state that supervenes when the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> dies is ‘something’ or ‘nothing’. All that matters is that the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span> — that is, suffering — cease without remainder. Consider how the Buddha sometimes would summarise his teachings: ‘Good, good, Anurādha. Formerly, Anurādha, and also now, I make known just suffering and the cessation of suffering’ (SN 22.86:13.1–13.2).128 And since suffering is coterminous with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, it follows that ‘<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is the greatest bliss’ (MN 75:21.5 and Dhp 204). What more can you ask for?</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> This would thus include the actual event of becoming an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>. As pointed out by <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, p.183, at SN 38.1:2.3–2.4 <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship is explicitly defined as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion. This shows the close relationship between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship in general. Harvey tries to show at some length that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> here refers to the event of attaining <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship, not an aspect of the general state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship. His first argument is that the Pali terminology points to an event rather than an ongoing reality. Without going into detail, it seems to me that the terminology is open to either interpretation, but most likely it refers to both. His second and main argument is based on the fact that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is the end of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dukkha</span> whereas the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> still has some <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dukkha</span> remaining and thus the general state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship cannot be called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>. But <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> at <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship is called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> ‘with residue remaining’ Iti 44:3.1–3.5, the residue being the experience of ‘what is agreeable and disagreeable … pleasure and pain (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dukkha</span>)’. It seems clear enough, therefore, that the presence of a residue of suffering does not bar the absence of lust, hatred and delusion in an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> from being called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> The literal meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is ‘extinguishment’. (Alternatively, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> could perhaps be translated as ‘extinction’. However, ‘extinction’ has such negative connotations in English—connotations that obviously do not pertain to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>—that ‘extinguishment’ seems more appropriate). <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion is therefore simply the permanent extinguishing of these three defilements. In fact, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is a relative term in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>, its precise connotation depending on what is being extinguished. At AN 9.47, AN 9.48, AN 9.49, AN 9.50 and AN 9.51 each <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">jhāna</span> and each immaterial attainment is said to be ‘provisional <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbānaṁ</span> … <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pariyāyena</span>)’. ‘Non-provisional <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>’ is reached at <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span>-ship, and ‘final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>’ at the death of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> (see below). In each case something is extinguished (either temporarily or permanently): in first <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">jhāna</span> the five hindrances and the five senses are temporarily extinguished, in the second <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">jhāna</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vitakka</span>-<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vicāra</span> etc.. At final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> all five aggregates are permanently extinguished.</p>

In his translation and explanation of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Abhidhammattha</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Saṅgaha</span>, in which he refers extensively to the above mentioned <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ṭīkā</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Bodhi 1993</span>, p.363 states that: ‘the attainment of fruition (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">phalasamāpatti</span>) is a meditative attainment by which a noble disciple enters into supramundane absorption with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as object’.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>It is difficult to ascertain with any precision when the idea of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as an object of consciousness first appears in Pali literature. It might be claimed that it appears already in the Canonical Abhidhamma where the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">asaṅkhatadhātu</span> is included in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhammāyatana</span> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/vb2/en/thittila?reference=main/pts&amp;highlight=false#pts-vp-pli72"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Vibh 72</span></a>). However, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">asaṅkhatadhātu</span> is then defined in exactly the same way as in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>, namely, as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/vb2/en/thittila?reference=main/pts&amp;highlight=false#pts-vp-pli73"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Vibh 73</span></a>). There is no indication that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is an ‘existing entity’ which is taken as a direct object of consciousness. Exactly how the commentaries understand <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is also a moot point. I am not able to discuss this here, since it would be a major study in itself to trace the historical development of how <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is understood in Pali literature.</p>

<li id="fn13"><div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> cannot simply be classified as a mind object—with the corresponding consciousness being mind-consciousness—since all mind objects and their corresponding objects are said to be impermanent and suffering; see e.g. SN 35.32. Indeed, the Salāyatana-Saṁyutta contains a large number of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> that directly state that mental phenomena (dhammas) are suffering. These statements often have an almost equational quality. And there is no clear statement anywhere in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> that there are any exceptions to this. In fact the six senses together with their six objects are called ‘the all’ (SN 35.23), clearly indicating that there are no further senses or sense objects apart from these. These statements taken together make it impossible, to my mind, to accept the idea of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> as a mind object cognised by mind-consciousness. (The post-canonical literature, however, sometimes seems to take a different position, see e.g. the Milindapañha, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mil6.2.5/en/tw_rhysdavids"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Mil 6.2.5</span></a>).</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> This interpretation hinges on understanding <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhavanirodho</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbānaṁ</span> to be an equational sentence: ‘the cessation of existence is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>’. On this reading, the expression is clearly an idea about <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>, not a direct reference to it. If instead one were to translate this phrase as two words in apposition, ‘the cessation of existence, Nibbāna’, then this would be a direct reference to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> and one would have to conclude that the phrase concerns a direct perception of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>. There are other suttas (AN 3.32, AN 10.6, AN 11.7, and AN 11.8), however, that speak of the same sort of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> but whose interpretation is unambiguous. In these <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> the relevant perception is given as ‘this is peaceful, this is sublime, that is … <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">etaṁ</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">santaṁ</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">etaṁ</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paṇītaṁ</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">yad</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">idaṁ</span> … <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbānan</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ti</span>)’. Here the wording is such—i.e. the verb ‘to be’ is required—that there can be no doubt that we are dealing with a sentence not just words in apposition. It seems quite clear, therefore, that this concerns a perception of an idea, an idea about <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>—i.e. ‘this is peaceful, this is sublime’—not a direct experience of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>. From this it is necessary to conclude that the expression <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhavanirodho</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbānaṁ</span> should also be understood as a sentence, not just two words in apposition.</p>

Harvey does not in fact use the words ‘permanent consciousness’ in describing final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span>. Instead, he says final <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is a ‘stopped discernment’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, p.201; ‘discernment’ being Harvey’s translation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>) or ‘consciousness beyond time’ (208). (He also argues that this ‘timeless’ <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> can be periodically experienced by the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arahant</span> during life, 208). But the idea that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nirodha</span> can be understood as a ‘stopped state’ rather than just ‘cessation’ is not supported by the use of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nirodha</span> in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span>. Wherever its meaning is unambiguous it means ‘ending’, ‘cessation’; there is never any sense that it refers to a ‘state’. To make his point Harvey also employs the double meaning in English of the word ‘stopped’. For him a ‘stopped discernment’ is thus a consciousness that stands still, continuing without change, not a consciousness that has ended. In Pali, however, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nirodha</span>/<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">niruddha</span> has no such double meaning, it only means ‘stopped’ as in ‘ceased’ or ‘ended’.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>As for Harvey’s use of the phrase ‘consciousness beyond time’, as opposed to ‘permanent consciousness’, it is difficult to see that it makes any difference. As a general tool of interpretation, it seems clear that the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nikāyas</span> cannot possibly refute every single formulation that constitutes a contradiction to their outlook. In many cases, such as the present one, one has to make reasonable assumptions as to the implications of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>’ statements. As far as I can see, a consciousness beyond time would for all practical purposes be the same as a permanent consciousness, since it is change that gives rise to a perception of time. Moreover, since <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nibbāna</span> is specifically said to be <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhuva</span>, ‘stable’ (SN 43.20), which in the suttas is used as a synonym for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nicca</span>, ‘permanent’, the idea of ‘consciousness beyond time’ as opposed to ‘permanent consciousness’ seems to be a red herring.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> Deep states of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> will be particularly attractive to grasp as a self because of their qualities of peace, stability, contentment, bliss, etc. If one has not heard or properly understood the Buddha’s teachings, it seems there will be an almost irresistible pull towards seeing these states as one’s true <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>An interesting passage in this context is found at DN 15:27.1–32.11. Here the Buddha asks the following semi-rhetorical question: ‘Where nothing at all is felt, could there be any sense of “I am” with reference to that (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tattha</span>)?’ (DN 15:30.3). From the subsequent conversation it is clear that the correct answer is ‘no’ and therefore that such a ‘state’ cannot be regarded as a self.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, p.31 seems to interpret this to mean that if there is no experience of ‘I am’ at the time one abides in a particular state, i.e. that there is no self-awareness in that state, then that is sufficient to show that that state cannot be regarded as a permanent self. If this were correct, then any deep state of samādhi, during which there is no perception ‘I am’, could also not be taken as a self. Yet, as I have argued above, it is perfectly possible to regard such states as an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attā</span> once one emerges from them.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>But the passage at DN 15:27.1–32.11 does not have to be interpreted as Harvey does. Its interpretation hinges on the import of the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tattha</span>, which Harvey translates as ‘there’. But, as is implied in my translation above, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tattha</span> frequently has a ‘locative’ sense, meaning ‘in this case’, ‘about this’, ‘with reference to this’. If this is the intended meaning also in the present case, then the passage means there can be no sense of ‘I am’ with reference to that state. In other words, one is incapable of taking that state as a permanent self even after one emerges from it, which is precisely what one would expect of a ‘state’ where nothing at all is felt, where nothing at all is experienced.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Footnote Characters"></span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Johansson 1969</span>, p.77 suggests ‘gone to rest’ and ‘gone home’ as translations of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">attham</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">agamā</span>.

<p>Harvey’s translation, ‘non-manifestive’, by which he means that nothing can ‘appear on or in’ this consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Harvey 1995</span>, p. 206), in my opinion stretches the meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> beyond what is reasonable. At the very least such a meaning would require a causative construction and probably something more involved (e.g. ‘the consciousness with which nothing else manifests’), not just the simple adjective. The straightforward meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> is that the consciousness itself is non-manifest.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="footnote text">
<p>Harvey supports his understanding by referring to a passage at MN 21:14.8–14.9 where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span>, together with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arūpī</span>, is used to describe space: no picture can be drawn ‘on’ space (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ākāsa</span>) since it is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anidassana</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arūpī</span>.

If this were possible then <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">arūpī</span> would also mean ‘non-manifestive’ (in Harvey’s sense of the word), which it clearly does not. It also seems worth noting that this consciousness must be ‘non-manifest’ with reference to something; that is, it is a relative non-manifestation, not an absolute one. At the very least it is not non-manifest for the person who experiences it.</p>
