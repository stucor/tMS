  {"id":"Analayo 2018a","abstract":"Join a rigorous scholar and Buddhist monk on a brisk tour of rebirth from ancient doctrine to contemporary debates. German Buddhist monk and university professor Bhikkhu Analayo had not given much attention to the topic of rebirth before some friends asked him to explore the treatment of the issue in early Buddhist texts. This succinct volume presents his findings, approaching the topic from four directions. The first chapter examines the doctrine of rebirth as it is presented in the earliest Buddhist sources and the way it relates to core doctrinal principles. The second chapter reviews debates about rebirth throughout Buddhist history and up to modern times, noting the role of confirmation bias in evaluation of evidence. Chapter 3 reviews the merits of current research on rebirth, including near-death experience, past-life regression, and children who recall previous lives. The chapter concludes with an examination of xenoglossy, the ability to speak languages one has not learned previously, and chapter 4 examines the particular case of Dhammaruwan, a Sri Lankan boy who chants Pali texts that he does not appear to have learned in his present life. Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research brings together the many strands of the debate on rebirth in one place, making it both comprehensive and compact. It is not a polemic but an interrogation of the evidence, and it leaves readers to come to their own conclusions.","author":[{"family":"Analayo","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"citation-key":"Analayo 2018a","event-place":"Somerville, MA","file":"Analayo_2018_Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research.pdf","ISBN":"978-1-61429-446-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,24]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"296","publisher":"Wisdom Publications,U.S.","publisher-place":"Somerville, MA","source":"Amazon","title":"Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Analayo 2022b","abstract":"Various dimensions of the cultivation of mindfulness in its early Buddhist historical setting can be better appreciated in the light of their doctrinal background. One aspect of this doctrinal background is the ancient Indian tetralemma, which differs from the Aristotelian logic that has informed much of Western thought. The tetralemma proposes that, in addition to affirmation and denial, at times a particular situation may be more appropriately captured by a combination of both (partly yes and partly no). Or else, another situation may call for neither affirmation nor negation. Although at first sight the resultant fourfold perspective can appear puzzling, closer inspection shows this model of thought to have a considerable potential for countering mental rigidity and enabling the transcendence of binary thought patterns, thereby being perhaps relevant to research on the relationship between mindfulness and cognitive flexibility.","author":[{"family":"Anālayo","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"citation-key":"Analayo 2022b","container-title":"Mindfulness","container-title-short":"Mindfulness","DOI":"10.1007/s12671-021-01678-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Beyond the Limitations of Binary Thinking: Mindfulness and the Tetralemma","title-short":"Beyond the Limitations of Binary Thinking","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"Bausch 2015a","abstract":"This dissertation traces regional philosophy in religious texts, namely the Kāṇva Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Suttanipāta. Receiving the Vedas in the East, Yājñavalkya and the Vājasaneyins enlivened earlier Vedic concepts and augmented Vedic propensities for asceticism. The region of Kosala flourished during the lifetime of Śākyamuni Buddha, and as a result, the Kāṇva School formed an important part of the cultural milieu in which the historical Buddha lived. The Suttanipāta depicts the Buddha as knowledgeable in Vedic practices and lore and as interacting with brāhmaṇas, arguably both before and after a separate Buddhist identity formed. Considering this background, the relationship between late Vedic and early Buddhist thought must be reassessed. Because value is acquired and erased when concepts circulate, the Buddha’s teaching in the Suttanipāta can be considered a philosophical project to create new concepts and to translate practices that respond to a changing milieu.Through a close analysis of Yājñavalkya’s interpretation of the agnihotra and Sāvitrī ṛk as related to cognitive processes, this study uncovers the metaphysical meaning of philosophical concepts, such as svàr, vā́ja, dhī́, and prajā, etc. In particular, the dissertation demonstrates that Yājñavalkya’s concept of karma (rite) in the Kāṇva Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa implies what is called karmic retribution. Vedic concepts for the unmanifest govern the idea of karmic retribution and the goal of becoming cognizant of the inflow of unmanifest energy in conscious cognition. The Buddha again revitalizes these concepts when teaching a brāhmaṇa audience in the Suttanipāta. The Buddhist concepts of upadhi, āsava, crossing over to the far shore, and the serpent shedding his skin enliven earlier Vedic philosophy, which was expressed in systems of conceptual metaphors. In this way, Kosalan philosophy in the Kāṇva Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Suttanipāta advances theories of causality and two modes of knowing—one karmically conditioned by past actions (saṃjñā/saññā), and the other a direct knowing (prajñāna/paññā) unmediated by karmic retribution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Bausch","given":"Lauren Michelle"}],"citation-key":"Bausch 2015a","file":"Bausch_2015_Kosalan Philosophy in the Kāṇva Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Suttanipāta.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"UC Berkeley","source":"escholarship.org","title":"Kosalan Philosophy in the Kāṇva Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Suttanipāta","type":"thesis","URL":"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2940b93h"},

  {"id":"Bodhi 1995a","abstract":"This book offers a complete translation of the Majjhima Nikāya, or Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, one of the major collections of texts in the Pali Canon, the authorized scriptures of Theravāda Buddhism. This collection—among the oldest records of the historical Buddha’s original teachings—consists of 152 suttas or discourses of middle length, distinguished as such from the longer and shorter suttas of the other collections. The Majjhima Nikāya might be concisely described as the Buddhist scripture that combines the richest variety of contextual settings with the deepest and most comprehensive assortment of teachings. These teachings, which range from basic ethics to instructions in meditation and liberating insight, unfold in a fascinating procession of scenarios that show the Buddha in living dialogue with people from many different strata of ancient Indian society: with kings and princes, priests and ascetics, simple villagers and erudite philosophers. Replete with drama, reasoned argument, and illuminating parable and simile, these discourses exhibit the Buddha in the full glory of his resplendent wisdom, majestic sublimity, and compassionate humanity.\n\nThe translation is based on an original draft translation left by the English scholar-monk Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli, which has been edited and revised by the American monk Bhikkhu Bodhi, who provides a long introduction and helpful explanatory notes. Combining lucidity of expression with accuracy, this translation enables the Buddha to speak across twenty-five centuries in language that addresses the most pressing concerns of the contemporary reader seeking clarification of the timeless issues of truth, value, and the proper conduct of life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,15]]},"citation-key":"Bodhi 1995a","event-place":"Boston","file":"1995_The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha.pdf","ISBN":"978-0-86171-072-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"language":"en","note":"attachment-label:Contents, Preface, Introduction & Summary of Suttas","number-of-pages":"1424","publisher":"Wisdom Publications","publisher-place":"Boston","title":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A new translation of the Majjhima Nikāya","translator":[{"family":"Ñāṇamoli","given":"Bhikkhu"},{"family":"Bodhi","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"type":"book","URL":"https://wisdomexperience.org/product/middle-length-discourses-buddha/"},

The Anguttara arranges the Buddha s discourses in accordance with a numerical scheme intended to promote retention and easy comprehension. In an age when writing was still in its infancy, this proved to be the most effective way to ensure that the disciples could grasp and replicate the structure of a teaching. A broad survey of the Anguttara Nikaya shows that its primary focus is on practice, and it treats practice from a wide-angle perspective. The subjects of the discourses range from the basic ethical observances recommended to the busy layperson, through the pillars of mind training, to the highest meditative attainments. The Anguttara is also distinguished among the four Nikayas by its interest in types of persons, which it describes and classifies in detail, often with stunning similes.

  {"id":"Bodhi 2017b","abstract":"The latest volume in the Teachings of the Buddha series translates the most ancient layer of the Buddha's teachings, a text that matches the Dhammapada in its concise power and its centrality to the Buddhist tradition. Celebrated translator Bhikkhu Bodhi illuminates these verses and their canonical commentaries with elegant renderings and authoritative annotation in this landmark volume. The Suttanipata, or \"Group of Discourses\" is a collection of sermons by the Buddha that includes some of the most popular suttas of the Pali Canon, such as the Loving-Kindness Sutta and the Rhinoceros-Horn Sutta. The suttas are primarily in verse, though several are in mixed prose and verse. The Suttanipata contains discourses that extol the figure of the muni, the illumined sage, who wanders homeless completely detached from the world. Other suttas, such as the Discourse on Downfall and the Discourse on Blessings, establish the foundations of Buddhist lay ethics. The last two chapters--the Atthakavagga (Chapter of Octads) and the Parayanavagga (The Way to the Beyond)--are considered to be among the most ancient parts of the Pali Canon. The Atthakavagga advocates a critical attitude toward views and doctrines. The Parayanavagga is a beautiful poem in which sixteen spiritual seekers travel across India to meet the Buddha and ask him profound questions pertaining to the highest goal.  The commentary, the Paramatthajotika, relates the background story to each sutta and explains each verse in detail. The volume includes numerous excerpts from the Niddesa, an ancient commentary already included in the Pali Canon, which offers detailed expositions of each verse in the Atthakavagga, the Parayanavagga, and the Rhinoceros Horn Sutta.  The translator provides a long, insightful introduction, a guide to the individual suttas, extensive notes, a list of parallels to the discourses of the Suttanipata, and a list of the numerical sets mentioned in the commentaries.","author":[{"family":"Bodhi","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"citation-key":"Bodhi 2017b","file":"","ISBN":"978-1-61429-429-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,26]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"1568","publisher":"Wisdom Publications,U.S.","title":"The Suttanipata: An Ancient Collection of Buddha's Discourses","title-short":"The Suttanipata","type":"book"},

In this way, students can determine the meaning of each word and phrase and gain an intimate familiarity with the distinctive style of the Pali suttas--with the words, and world, of the earliest Buddhist texts.  Ven. Bodhi's meticulously selected anthology of suttas provides a systematic overview of the Buddha's teachings, mirroring the four noble truths, the most concise formulation of the Buddha's guide to liberation.

Bhikkhu Bodhi gave a series of lectures on the fundamental teachings of Early Buddhism. Bhante Gunaratana, at the time the President of the Buddhist Vihara Society, suggested he record the lectures so that the Vihara could distribute them as a set of cassette tapes.\n\nIn the summer of 1981, Ven. Bodhi recorded his ten lectures in the basement of the Washington Buddhist Vihara, using an ordinary, nonprofessional recorder.

  {"id":"Brahmali 2009a","abstract":"The only way of moving towards consensus on the controversial subject of the nature of Nibbana is by appealing to the sole source of authority common to practically all Buddhists: the Nikayas/Agamas. In the present paper I will first give an overview of the usage of the term Nibbana in the Nikayas. I will then argue that, according to the Nikayas, Nibbana cannot be regarded as a self. Next, I will point out that the Nikayas do not see Nibbana as a form of consciousness, including such exceptional kinds of consciousness as anidassana viññana and appatitthita viññana. Nor can Nibbana be regarded as equivalent to mind, or any particular state of mind. In the final section I aim to show that the most reasonable interpretation of the Nikayas is that final Nibbana is no more than the cessation of the five khandhas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Brahmāli","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"call-number":"Original 2009","citation-key":"Brahmali 2009a","container-title":"Buddhist Studies Review","DOI":"10.1558/bsrv.v26i1.33","file":"Brahmāli_2009_What the Nikayas Say and Do not Say about Nibbana.pdf","ISSN":"1747-9681","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",8,22]]},"language":"en","note":"attachment-label:Original 2009\ntMS:niknib","page":"33-66","source":"journal.equinoxpub.com","title":"What the Nikayas Say and Do not Say about Nibbana","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSR/article/view/8891","volume":"26"},

The SN and SA are essentially two different versions of the same collection of discourses.This study builds on the work of Yin Shun, which demonstrates the historical importance of SN/SA in the formation of the early Buddhist canon. In particular, it is based on Yin Shun's recognition of the three-anga structure of SN/SA, and of the status of its Sutranga portion as of prime importance in the historical formation of this nikaya/agama, and as containing the most fundamental teachings of Buddha. The aim of this research is to reveal and clarify the similarities and differences between SN and SA, with regard to the principal Buddhist teachings contained in their Sutranga portion.","author":[{"family":"Choong","given":"Mun-Keat"}],"citation-key":"Choong 2000a","event-place":"Wiesbaden","file":"Choong_2000_The Fundamental Teachings of Early Buddhism, A Comparative Study Based on the.pdf","ISBN":"978-3-447-04232-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"269","publisher":"Harrassowitz","publisher-place":"Wiesbaden","title":"The Fundamental Teachings of Early Buddhism, A Comparative Study Based on the Sūtrāṅga portion of the Pāli Saṃyutta-Nikāya and the Chinese Saṃyuktāgama","title-short":"The Fundamental Teachings of Early Buddhism","type":"book"},

  {"id":"CollectedPapers 1","abstract":"Although many Buddhist studies scholars spend a great deal of their time involved in acts of translation, to date not much has been published that examines the key questions, problems, and difficulties faced by translators of South Asian Buddhist texts and epigraphs. Translating Buddhism seeks to address this omission. The essays collected here represent a burgeoning attempt to begin to shape the subfield of translation studies within Buddhist studies, whereby scholars actively challenge primary routine decisions and basic assumptions. Exploring questions including how interpretive translators can be and how cultural and social norms affect translations, the book draws on the broad experiences of its contributors—all of whom are translators themselves—who bring different themes to the table. Each chapter can be used either independently or as part of the whole to engender reflections on the process of translation.","citation-key":"CollectedPapers 1","editor":[{"family":"Collett","given":"Alice"}],"file":"Collett_2021_Translating Buddhism.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,1]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"348","publisher":"SUNY Press","source":"Amazon","title":"Translating Buddhism: Historical and Contextual Perspectives","title-short":"Translating Buddhism","type":"book"},

It is intended to be a textbook for students of religious and Asian studies respectively, but will also be of interest to those who want a general survey of Buddhism and its beliefs. Unlike many other general books about Buddhism, it not only explores Buddhist beliefs, but also seeks to show as a set of practices. It thus includes chapters on devotion, ethics, monastic practices and meditation. Such practices are related to Buddhist teachings and historical developments. Emphasising as it does the diversity found within different Buddhist traditions, the book aims to underline common threads of belief, practice and historical continuities which unify the Buddhist world.

  {"id":"JonesDhivan 2022a","abstract":"This article investigates the original meaning of dependent arising in the Buddha’s teaching, by focussing on the imasmiṃ sati formula. Modern scholars such as the Rhys Davidses, K.N. Jayatilleke and Paul Williams have interpreted it as a principle of causation, comparable to a scientific conception of causation. I argue instead that this formula implies that the Buddha held that causation is nothing more than the correlation of causes and effects, and that it commits the Buddha to a Humean regularity thesis about causation. I draw a distinction between the Buddhist and scientific concepts of causation, and then summarise an alternative approach made by more recent scholars such as Sue Hamilton, Noa Ronkin and Eviatar Shulman, who present dependent arising in terms of conditionality in the causal structure of subjective experience. I conclude by presenting the argument that the imasmiṃ sati formula does not express a principle of causation but is rather a formula for the method of discovering and presenting causation as conditionality in experience.","author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Dhivan Thomas"}],"citation-key":"JonesDhivan 2022a","container-title":"Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies","file":"Jones_2022_“This Being, That Becomes.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"119-155","title":"“This Being, That Becomes:” Reconsidering the Role of The Imasmiṃ Sati Formula in Early Buddhism","type":"article-journal","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"Lopez 1997a","abstract":"It is well known from the work of Wilhelm Rau that the opposition of eater (attṛ) and eaten (adya) is used by the Vedic poets as a conceptual frame to articulate social ideology. 2 As Ś.B 13.2.9.8 and numerous other passages put it: the brahmins and the kṣatriya-s unite to ‘eat’ the people (viś). Life and society are understood by the Vedic poets in terms of the basic struggle of acquiring food. Food itself becomes the most basic conceptual tool by which the functioning of the human being, human society and the cosmos are understood. Food as a conceptual tool may be seen in its most basic form in the statement of Taittirīya Upaniṣad (TU) 3.10, which identifies food (annam) as prathamajā ṛtasya “the first born of ṛta.” That annam is conceived as more than just everyday, edible goods is clear from the fact that food is personified as the first born progeny of the most important abstract power in the Veda, namely, ñta, “the active power of truth,” which underlies all cosmic, divine and human action. In this passage, food is placed at the center of the eschatological vision of Vedic culture. Immortality, an unending existence in the next world, is articulated in terms of food. This paper begins to explore the role of food, as a general category, in the expression of concepts and ideas that form part of the eschatological vision of Vedic religion. The focus of this paper will be to show that key eschatological concepts - the notion of immortality (amṛta),3 the vision of heaven, and its opposite (nirṛti ) - are construed within a ‘nutritionally fixated’ worldview; a worldview that at every turn construes ideas, concepts, and processes (both cosmic and human) from the point of view nutritional necessity. This does not mean, of course, that this is the only worldview present in the Vedic texts; rather this gastronomic worldview is one that can be pieced together from various hints and suggestions that are scattered throughout the corpus of Vedic literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lopez","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"Lopez 1997a","container-title":"Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies","DOI":"10.11588/EJVS.1997.3.824","file":"Lopez_1997_Food and Immortality in the Veda.pdf","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"language":"en","page":"11-19 Seiten","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Food and Immortality in the Veda: A Gastronomic Theology?","title-short":"Food and Immortality in the Veda","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hasp.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/ejvs/article/view/824","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"Ñanamoli 1956a","abstract":"The Visuddhimagga is the \"great treatise\" of Theravada Buddhism, an encyclopedic manual of doctrine and meditation written in the fifth century by the great Buddhist commentator, Buddhaghosa.The most esteemed commentary in all of Pali literature, The Path of Purification, or Visuddhimagga, is a systematic examination and condensation of Buddhist doctrine and meditation technique. The various teachings of the Buddha, found throughout the Pali Canon, are organized in a clear, comprehensive manner. In the course of his treatise Buddhaghosa gives full and detailed instructions on the forty subjects of meditation aimed at concentration, an elaborate account of the Buddhist Abhidhamma philosophy, and explicit descriptions of the stages of insight culminating in final liberation.The author, Bhadantacaryia Buddhaghosa, composed the Visuddhimagga in the early part of the 5th century A.D. The India-born monk-scholar traveled to Sri Lanka to translate into Pali the extensive Sinhalese commentaries preserved there. His crystallization of the entire Pali Canon reinvigorated Theravada Buddhism in India and Sri Lanka. It still shines as clearly today, in this brilliant 1956 translation by the British-born monk, Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli, that in itself is considered an outstanding achievement of Pali scholarship of the 20th century.This book is from BPS Pariyatti Editions, which co-publishes classic and contemporary titles from the Buddhist Publication Society of Kandy, Sri Lanka.","author":[{"family":"Buddhaghosa","given":"Bhadantacariya"}],"citation-key":"Ñanamoli 1956a","file":"","issued":{"date-parts":[["1956"]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Pariyatti Publishing","title":"The Path of Purification: Visuddhimagga","title-short":"The Path of Purification","translator":[{"family":"Ñanamoli","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"type":"book"},

  {"id":"Olalde 2015a","abstract":"Nāmarūpa (literally “name and form”) is widely known as a Buddhist concept, relevant in the context of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda), and the skandhas. Yet, the compound is also found in the early Upaniṣads and a closer look at the Vedic corpus reveals that nāman and rūpa also appear closely related to each other in earlier texts. Generally, textual scholars explain nāmarūpa—both in Buddhist and non-Buddhist texts—as a designation of “individuality” or “empirical reality,” whereby nāman and rūpa tend to be regarded as counterparts. In this paper I consider the “non-Buddhist” use of the term from a linguistic perspective. Inspired on a 1987 article by Edward S. Small, I intend to explore to what extent modern theories on the linguistic sign—such as Saussure’s bipartite model of signifier and signified, and the triangle of reference of Ogden and Richards (1923)—may shed light on the relationship between nāman and rūpa and help us establish finer nuances in the meaning of the compound. The purpose of this analysis is to challenge tacit assumptions about language in recent interpretations of nāmarūpa and thus contribute to a better understanding of its usage in Buddhist texts prior to the systematization of the Abhidharma.","author":[{"family":"Olalde","given":"Liudmila"}],"citation-key":"Olalde 2015a","DOI":"10.11588/HEIDOK.00023687","event-place":"Bangkok","event-title":"16th World Sanskrit Conference","file":"Olalde_2015_Nāmarūpa; a Linguistic Perspective.pdf","issued":{"literal":"2015, June 30"},"license":"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives Germany","publisher":"Heidelberg University Library","publisher-place":"Bangkok","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Nāmarūpa; a Linguistic Perspective","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/id/eprint/23687"},

It then analyses the nature of the causes linking each pair of neighbouring factors, using a Western model of causality. It examines why the Buddha placed such importance on dependent origination? Asks what is its purpose? And in the final section it proposes that the function of dependent origination is threefold: To explain how there can be rebirth without a soul. To answer the question “What is life?” To understand why there is suffering, and where suffering comes to an end.","author":[{"family":"Brahm","given":"Ajahn"}],"citation-key":"wiswo-doab","container-title":"Wisdom & Wonders","file":"","genre":"Dhamma Book","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"English","title":"Dependent Origination","type":"webpage","URL":"https://wiswo.org/books/doab"},

  {"id":"wiswo-niknib","abstract":"The only way of moving towards consensus on the controversial subject of the nature of Nibbana is by appealing to the sole source of authority common to practically all Buddhists: the Nikayas/Agamas. In the present paper I will first give an overview of the usage of the term Nibbana in the Nikayas. I will then argue that, according to the Nikayas, Nibbana cannot be regarded as a self. Next, I will point out that the Nikayas do not see Nibbana as a form of consciousness, including such exceptional kinds of consciousness as anidassana viññana and appatitthita viññana. Nor can Nibbana be regarded as equivalent to mind, or any particular state of mind. In the final section I aim to show that the most reasonable interpretation of the Nikayas is that final Nibbana is no more than the cessation of the five khandhas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Brahmāli","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"citation-key":"wiswo-niknib","container-title":"Wisdom & Wonders","file":"","genre":"Dhamma Book","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","title":"What the Nikayas Say and Do not Say about Nibbana","type":"webpage","URL":"https://wiswo.org/books/niknib"},
