It is one of the oldest Upanishads. It lists as number 9 in the Muktika canon of 108 Upanishads.</p><p>The Upanishad belongs to the <em>Tandya</em> school of the Samaveda. Like <em>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</em>, the Chandogya is an anthology of texts that must have pre-existed as separate texts, and were edited into a larger text by one or more ancient Indian scholars. The precise chronology of <em>Chandogya Upanishad</em> is uncertain, and it is variously dated to have been composed by the 8th to 6th century BCE in India.</p><p>It is one of the largest Upanishadic compilations, and has eight <em>Prapathakas</em> (literally lectures, chapters), each with many volumes, and each volume contains many verses.The volumes are a motley collection of stories and themes. As part of the poetic and chants-focussed Samaveda, the broad unifying theme of the Upanishad is the importance of speech, language, song and chants to man’s quest for knowledge and salvation, to metaphysical premises and questions, as well as to rituals.</p><p>The <em>Chandogya Upanishad</em> is notable for its lilting metric structure, its mention of ancient cultural elements such as musical instruments, and embedded philosophical premises that later served as foundation for Vedanta school of Hinduism. It is one of the most cited texts in later <em>Bhasyas</em> (reviews and commentaries) by scholars from the diverse schools of Hinduism. Adi Shankaracharya, for example, cited <em>Chandogya Upanishad</em> 810 times in his <em>Vedanta Sutra Bhasya</em>, more than any other ancient text.</p>"
