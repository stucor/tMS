<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Dependent Arising is one of the Buddha’s most important and central doctrines, but in recent decades it has been interpreted in a large variety of ways. This book illustrates that the early Buddhist texts support the traditional multiple-lifetime interpretation of this teaching, taking a particular interest in the factor of consciousness. Centered around three similes, it connects this factor to rebirth and explains how it relates to the other factors of Dependent Arising. It also explains that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, a term used in the similes, refers to the cessation of consciousness.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>About three years ago I wrote a rather technical essay on an obscure pair of Pāli words, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa anidassana</span>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> These words are sometimes understood to describe a kind of consciousness of <span data-custom-style="wwc-sanskrit">nirvāṇa</span>, but I argued they refer to a state of meditation instead. I expected few to be interested in such technical analysis, but it was surprisingly well received. Afterwards I was asked to explain a similar pair of words that gets likewise misunderstood, namely <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>. Initially I was reluctant to do more of the same, but then realized it would be a good opportunity to illustrate some aspects of the Buddha’s teachings which continue to amaze me and which may also amaze the reader, because this subject is a good example of how interconnected his teachings are, of how words and concepts reappear throughout the discourses, illuminating the same ideas from different angles. It also gives me a chance to showcase the Buddha’s beautiful use of metaphors for even the deepest of concepts, hopefully shedding some light on the more enigmatic parts of his teachings on Dependent Arising.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As such, this writing is not meant to be a critique but a constructive step towards a better understanding and appreciation of the Buddha’s teachings. But for context, let me briefly lay out the views I consider to be mistaken. The assumption is that enlightened beings experience a certain kind of objectless or contentless consciousness which the Buddha called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, usually translated by proponents of the idea as ‘unestablished consciousness’.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Some further think this consciousness lies outside of conditioned phenomena and will continue to exist after the enlightened being passes away. Often referenced in support of these ideas is a passage wherein the Buddha supposedly compares this unestablished consciousness to a beam of light that does not land on any surface.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With this book I wish not to be argumentative but aim to present an alternative interpretation of the terms and simile in question. At some occasions, however, I do address the idea of an objectless consciousness directly. This was inevitable, because in my understanding the Buddha specifically denied the existence of such a consciousness, and this happens to be the exact point he was making with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>. I will show that the term refers not to an unestablished consciousness but to the non-establishing of consciousness in any object or place, particularly at the enlightened being’s time of death, after which there will be no rebirth and hence no more consciousness. Also involved is a simile in which consciousness is a seed for rebirth, where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> is more aptly translated as ‘consciousness is not planted’.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All this is explained in three parts:</p>
</div>
<ol type="I">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The first part introduces the wider context of Dependent Arising and a simile of painting a picture of a person, which illustrates the creation of rebirth. It also provides some historical context for the factor of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, quite literally ‘name and form’, translated here as ‘the (individual’s) immaterial aspects and body’.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The second part explains the simile of the seed of consciousness, clarifying that this simile, like that of the painting, illustrates rebirth too. It also discusses the dependent existence of all consciousness, the impossibility for consciousness to be without object or content.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The third part gives my interpretation of the disputed simile of the light beam, showing that this simile implies the cessation of consciousness. Some connected statements on the final goal are also touched upon.</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Since this writing is essentially a patchwork of translations and notes made over the span of nearly a decade, there will be a few tangents along the way as well. My hope is that these will not distract from the main ideas but add to them instead. Some of these tangents may also reflect that I am not an academic but a practitioner interested in the real-life application of these texts and that I write with a similar audience in mind. Still, please know that this is first and foremost a study of texts, not a guide to practice. A proper understanding of the texts can guide the practitioner in the right direction, however. If anything, I hope you will find some inspiration in the Buddha’s rich metaphors.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, quotations of the Buddhist canonical texts should be attributed to the Buddha. All translations of the Pāli, including any inevitable shortcomings in them, are my own. Unfamiliar translations will always raise some questions, but to not interrupt the continuity of ideas, I will not explain every translation choice I made and include the Pāli terms only when deemed relevant. Some translations directly connected to the topic are explained in the endnotes, which further contain only references to the source texts and contemporary works.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Realizing that the Pāli Canon is not infallible, I also consulted the Chinese Āgamas, assisted by English translations of others. My knowledge of these texts is limited, so I cannot claim this to be a proper comparative study of early texts—nor was it intended to be—but some interesting observations were made regardless. I hope this will encourage a wider recognition of the Chinese canon and less reliance on unique Pāli passages.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>My highest wish, and the real purpose behind this book, is for the Buddha’s words to help the reader find the escape from suffering. I will share some further thoughts on this in the conclusion.</p>

<p>A handful of <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">suttas</span> in the Pāli Canon contain <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, the term which I intend to show does not refer to an unestablished consciousness of <span data-custom-style="wwc-sanskrit">nirvāṇa</span> (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbāna</span> in Pāli) but to the cessation of consciousness. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> (§23) will be our main focus, because it contains the disputed simile of the light beam that does not hit anything.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But first an important point on the five aggregates: form, sensation, perception, will, and consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa, vedanā, saññā, saṇkhāra, viññāna</span>). Most readers will be familiar with them, but many may not know why the Buddha called them ‘aggregates’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>). The suttas say they are so called because they include, or they “aggregate”, all the different types of the item in question.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> A <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandha</span> is literally a heap or a collection. The aggregate of perception, for example, is the collection of all perceptions. The same principle applies to the aggregate of consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>):</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§1</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The aggregate of consciousness includes any type of consciousness whatsoever—whether past, present, or future; here or elsewhere; internal or external; coarse or subtle; lowly or sublime. That is how the term ‘aggregate’ applies to the aggregates.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>That this statement is intended to be all-encompassing is clarified even further elsewhere when the Buddha says: “any type of consciousness whatsoever—whether past, present, or future [and so on]—<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">all</span> consciousness …”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Similar phrases are spoken of the other four aggregates, so if we were to suppose some special type of consciousness that’s excluded from the aggregate of consciousness,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> we also open the door for similar types of form, sensation, perception, and will. We then have to admit that the definitions of the other aggregates are also not all-encompassing. But this is not the intent behind these statements, which the Buddha meant to be comprehensive. As said, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">all</span> types of consciousness are included in the aggregates, just like all types of form, sensation, perception, and will.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Accordingly, throughout the entire corpus the Buddha never tells his audience there is a consciousness outside of the aggregates. In one discourse a god called Baka seems to claim there is such a consciousness, but the Buddha disagrees with him.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Whenever he uses the word ‘consciousness’, it always refers either to the whole aggregate of consciousness or otherwise to a certain part of it. This is the whole purpose of his definition of the aggregate: to make sure we don’t leave any type of consciousness out.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Consciousness-in-the-If-There-is-Desire-Discourse'>Consciousness in the If There is Desire Discourse</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>That ‘consciousness’ refers to the aggregate is even more clearly the case for the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>. It is located in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>, the connected discourses on Dependent Arising, and in this context ‘consciousness’ is repeatedly and explicitly defined as the consciousnesses of the six senses—which is to say, as the aggregate of consciousness:<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what is consciousness? There are six kinds of consciousness: sight-consciousness, hearing-consciousness, smell-consciousness, taste-consciousness, touch-consciousness, and mind-consciousness. That [taken together] is what’s called consciousness.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Throughout the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>, including the simile of the light beam and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, ‘consciousness’ refers to this aggregate. We are not dealing with a special type of consciousness that is outside of this aggregate (or outside of this ‘aspect of existence’, as I will translate <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandha</span> from here on).</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Moreover, the discourse contains not just the simile of the light beam which is sometimes taken to describe a type of “unestablished” consciousness of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbāna</span>. It is preceded by a simile of a painting which describes an <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">establishing</span> of consciousness. With this information the well-informed reader may already be able to tell what is going on, once they recall that the discourse is on Dependent Arising. In brief, the simile of the painting illustrates the origination sequence of Dependent Arising; the simile of the light beam illustrates the cessation sequence. The former sequence includes the arising of consciousness; the latter includes its ceasing. So <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> is actually about the cessation of consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All this will be explained in detail in this book. But before we consider the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> and its similes, we need a general understanding of Dependent Arising first.</p>

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-origin-of-suffering'>The origin of suffering</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In my opinion the best way to explain Dependent Arising—also called Dependent Origination—is by starting with the second noble truth (or ‘noble one’s truth’, as I translate <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariyasacca</span>).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This truth tells us that the cause of suffering is the craving that leads to a next life:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what is the noble one’s truth of the origin of suffering? It is the craving that leads to a next life, which, along with enjoyment and desire, looks for happiness in various realms.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> That is what’s called the noble one’s truth of the origin of suffering.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Dependent Arising is in essence an expanded explanation of this truth:<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what is the noble one’s truth of the origin of suffering? Dependent on ignorance, there are willful actions. Dependent on willful actions, [the continuation of] consciousness. Dependent on consciousness, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. Dependent on the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, the six senses. Dependent on the six senses, sense impressions. Dependent on sense impressions, sensations. Dependent on sensations, craving. Dependent on craving, fuel/taking up. Dependent on fuel/taking up, [further] existence. Dependent on existence, birth. And dependent on birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates. That is what’s called the noble one’s truth of the origin of suffering.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Dependent Arising is often believed to be a very complicated teaching, but it is not. It’s very <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">deep</span>, very hard to see, but it should not be theoretically difficult. As said, it is essentially an explanation of the second truth of the noble one, and explanations should not be much more complicated than the thing they try to explain!</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Venerable Sāriputta once explained the fundamental principles of Dependent Arising quite succinctly:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The Buddha said: ‘If you see the dependent arising of things,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> you see the Dhamma [the truth/teaching]. If you see the Dhamma, you see the dependent arising of things.’ And what has dependently arisen are these five taken up aspects of existence. Wanting them and holding on to them, being attracted and attached to them, will make suffering originate. Removing and abandoning the want and desire for them, will make suffering cease.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The arising of the five aspects of existence here means their overall existence. By this I mean, Sāriputta is talking about the origination of these aspects of existence <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">as a whole</span>, not about momentary changes within them. This origination of the aspects of existence happens at the start of life, when one is born. This is reflected by the definition of ‘birth’ in §20, which includes “the manifestation of the aspects of existence”. Sāriputta’s summary of Dependent Arising therefore aligns with the noble one’s second truth, on the craving that leads to <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">a next life</span>. That is to say, Dependent Arising primarily explains why rebirth happens.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another short version of Dependent Arising likewise mentions that the origination of the five aspects of existence happens through birth, which in turn is caused by enjoyment and attachment:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what is the origin of form, sensation, perception, will, and consciousness? Then you enjoy, welcome, and keep holding on. You enjoy, welcome, and keep holding on to what?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>You enjoy, welcome, and keep holding on to form. It results in enjoyment, and when there is enjoyment of form, there is fuel/taking up. Dependent on fuel/taking up, there is [further] existence. Dependent on existence, there is birth. And dependent on birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates. [Similar for the other aspects of existence.]<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Because the aspects of existence are suffering which starts (or, more accurately, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">re</span>starts) at birth, the Buddha also said:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Mendicants, the arising, continuation, production, and manifestation of form is the arising of suffering, the continuation of diseases, and the manifestation of old age and death. The arising, continuation, production, and manifestation of sensation, perception, will, and consciousness is the arising of suffering, the continuation of diseases, and the manifestation of old age and death.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The cessation, subsiding, and disappearance of form is the cessation of suffering, the subsiding of diseases, and the disappearance of old age and death. The cessation, subsiding, and disappearance of sensation, perception, will, and consciousness is the cessation of suffering, the subsiding of diseases, and the disappearance of old age and death.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The arising, continuation, production, and manifestation of the aspects of existence here means their continuation into a new life after death. It is this kind of continuation which results in more deaths: their continuation while one is already alive does not. Accordingly, the words ‘production’ and ‘manifestation’ are also found in the very definition of birth, namely in the phrases ‘the production of beings’ and ‘the manifestation of the aspects of existence’. In fact, the word for ‘production’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhinibbatti</span>) also means ‘rebirth’.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Venerable Sujato translated it as such in the above discourse, and Venerable Bodhi did so elsewhere.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The aspects of existence, and therefore death and other suffering, cease only when the enlightened being passes away. As the Buddha said after the death of the enlightened monk Dabba:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>The body fell apart, perception ceased,<br>
all sensations cooled off,<br>
will subsided,<br>
consciousness disappeared.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>When Sāriputta mentioned the cessation of suffering in §5, he referred to this final cessation of the aspects of existence. It is only then, after one final death, that old age and death and all suffering are truly overcome.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is important to realize that Dependent Arising explains rebirth and its causes. If we fail to acknowledge this, it becomes impossible to properly understand the Buddha’s similes and terminology, including <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>. But since some prevalent interpretations don’t recognize or otherwise marginalize this central principle, I will return to it throughout this writing, showing in various ways that Dependent Arising indeed focuses on rebirth. My apologies if at some point this becomes repetitious, but I think a topic as important as this deserves to be treated thoroughly.</p>

<p>The sequential arising of these twelve factors is usually followed by their sequential cessation, which has no official name in the discourses. Some have termed it ‘Dependent Cessation’, but I will just call it ‘the cessation sequence’. In the following text the Buddha gives both the arising sequence and cessation sequence in their standard form, after, just like Sāriputta, saying he is concerned with the arising and cessation of the five aspects of existence.</p>

</ul>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>We can rephrase this more modernly as:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There will be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">B</span>, only if there is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">A</span>. <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">B</span> arises, because <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">A</span> arises.</p>

</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Much has been philosophized about these short sentences, but the principle they describe is not difficult to understand. For the sake of illustration, here is first an example of the principle applied to something outside of Dependent Arising:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There will be rain, only if there are clouds. Rain happens because clouds form.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If there are no clouds, there won’t be rain. If the clouds disappear, the rain will stop.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Rain depends on clouds.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The point is simple: there can be no rain without clouds. In other words, rain <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">requires</span> clouds. Clouds are <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">needed for</span> rain. Rain <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">depends on</span> clouds. Or, for those familiar with logical terminology, clouds are <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">a necessary condition</span> for rain.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But the Buddha did not apply his investigation to rain, nor to any other phenomena in the outside world.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> He was interested in suffering, which is found inside of beings. So next is an example of the principle that stays within the context where it was meant to be applied, that of Dependent Arising:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There will be death, only if there is birth. Death happens because birth happened first.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If there is no birth, there won’t be death. If birth ceases, death will cease.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Death depends on birth.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Put simply: you will die because you were born; but if you don’t get reborn, you won’t die again.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This principle is called ‘dependency’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">idap-paccayatā</span>),<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> which explains the name ‘Dependent Arising’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paṭicca-samuppāda</span>). The words <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paccaya</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paṭicca</span> both come from the verb <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pacceti</span>, meaning ‘to fall back on, to depend on’. The principle has also been called ‘conditionality’, which loses the link between these two terms but means the same.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The principle of dependency applies not only to birth and death, but to all the links: death depends on birth, birth depends on the continuation of existence, and so on through the rest of the chain. So in the end all factors rely on ignorance. Imagine a tower of twelve bricks stacked on top of one another. If you remove the bottom brick, the whole stack will come crashing down. Why? Because the bricks supported one another, and they all relied on the bottom brick. Similarly, if you remove ignorance, all the other factors also will cease to be. Why? Because in the end they all depended on ignorance. If you end ignorance, you will therefore also end suffering. It takes some time for the tower to fall down, though. Suffering does not end immediately when ignorance ends, but only at the end of life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To illustrate:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-figure">

Figure 1. Dependent Arising as a tower of bricks</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Since this may all sound rather theoretical so far, I must emphasize that the principle of dependency is a means of reflection, not a mere philosophical theory. Whenever it is mentioned in the Pāli Canon, it always describes someone’s empirical insights or reflections. For example, in §49: “You closely and properly focus on the dependent arising of things, reflecting: ‘There will be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">this</span>, only if there is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">that</span>. […] That is to say: Dependent on ignorance […]” The principle is meant to be applied to your personal experience to understand, among other things, how you yourself have been creating rebirth and may do so again in the future.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-centrality-of-rebirth'>The centrality of rebirth</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Many of the links in Dependent Arising are not only necessary conditions but also sufficient conditions.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Sufficient conditions guarantee their outcome. For example, if there is birth, there will always be death as a consequence. Birth <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">guarantees</span> death. Therefore, birth is a sufficient condition for death (as well as a necessary one). But not all links are sufficient conditions. Just like a cloudy sky does not guarantee that it will rain, sensations don’t guarantee craving, for example. If they did, there would be no way to stop craving! So sensations are not a sufficient condition for craving. Likewise, craving and ignorance do not guarantee birth, because you may have those defilements today, but get enlightened tomorrow, whereafter you will not be reborn again. So your craving and ignorance were not sufficient conditions for birth. That said, this distinction between necessary and sufficient conditions can quickly become too technical, if it hasn’t already. It is not mentioned in the discourses either, so it may be better to not overthink it. The links that are sufficient conditions are quite clear anyway, once the meaning of the factors is explained.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>However, there is one link where sufficiency may not be evident, and it just so happens to be the most important one: that between birth and suffering. It means that once you are born and alive, suffering is inevitable. Only by not getting reborn again, can you end suffering. This insight forms one of the backbones of Dependent Arising. Rebirth therefore is the primary issue this teaching addresses. As the Buddha said to Ānanda:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching [of Dependent Arising] that this population […] does leave behind the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the nether world, and transmigration (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>).<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The focal point of Dependent Arising is also very clear in the next passage. Here the Buddha says he obtained his own insights into Dependent Arising after wondering how rebirth can be stopped. He investigated this matter using the principle of dependency in its various phrasings, starting at old age and death and working his way back to ignorance. Discourses like this are usually abbreviated, but to clarify how the principle of dependency applies to all links, I included it in full.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In this text ‘old age and death’ is used as a shorthand for all suffering. This is a common feature in the discourses, especially those on Dependent Arising. Old age and death are a shorthand for suffering not only because they are some of its more noticeable forms, but also because as long as there still is a possibility for old age and death—that is to say, as long as you are alive—there will still be suffering. To clarify, in the Discourse on Direct Conditions it is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">suffering</span> which is said to be directly dependent on birth, not old age and death as in the standard sequence. It says: “And what is the direct condition for suffering? Birth, you should answer.”<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> This also reinforces what was mentioned before, that once a being is born, suffering is inevitable as long as they are alive.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-meaning-of-the-factors'>The meaning of the factors</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>While the principle of dependency and its application to the twelve factors are conveyed very clearly in the previous discourse, the actual meaning of the factors is not. The Buddha did not explain what ‘birth’ exactly refers to, for example. Most suttas on Dependent Arising similarly mention the standard sequence with little to no explanation of what the individual factors mean. I can think of two main reasons for this, and they are important to consider if we want to properly understand Dependent Arising.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>One, the bare twelvefold sequence is not meant to be a full explanation itself, but primarily serves as a mnemonic device (something easy to remember).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> The audience would have heard more detailed explanations and definitions of the twelve factors in other discourses, which they would have had in the backs of their minds while listening to the more bare sequences of factors. We should do the same, not taking the factors in isolation but consider how they are used and defined elsewhere. If we were to focus on the twelve words and ignore the wider context, we could give these words—which moreover are in an ancient language that is not completely understood—almost any meaning we’d like.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Two, to people back then the individual links would have been more self-explanatory than they are to us. Many of the links may make immediate sense to us as well, such as that between birth and death and that between sensations and craving. But some links do not make sense right away, like that between consciousness and the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, especially when the latter (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>) is translated as ‘name and form’. The Buddha discovered a timeless principle, but the words he used to explain this principle are not timeless. They were spoken at a specific point in time, to a certain audience that had different ideas than us. This we should also take into account. If we interpret these historical texts too much from a contemporary perspective, we are bound to misunderstand things. In linguistic studies this is called <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">presentism</span>: “the anachronistic introduction of present-day ideas and perspectives into depictions or interpretations of the past”.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The language gap and cultural divide also mean someone could fully understand the general principle of Dependent Arising through direct insight, even be fully enlightened, but still not understand what words like <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> mean (or what any Pāli word means, for that matter). For this reason we should also be careful to stay objective about the texts and not interpret them too much in light of our own subjective ideas, even if we are very wise. If we do have deep insights, it does become a lot easier to interpret the words rightly, but it is still no guarantee. Unfortunately, insight into the Dhamma does not come with miraculous linguistic abilities!</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reader should also be aware that translations are by their nature always imperfect. As K.R. Norman, one of the greatest Pāli linguists, said: “It is very difficult to give a one for one translation of Sanskrit and Pāli words into English. It is very rare that one Sanskrit or Pāli word has exactly the same connotations, no less and no more, as one English word.”<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> This is even more true when dealing with topics as abstract as Dependent Arising. But leaving words in Pāli is no solution either, as Norman also continued to say, so I use English terms here, accepting their inevitable shortcomings. The meaning of these terms will have to be clarified by their explanations more so than by the translations themselves. This applies especially to ‘consciousness’, as we shall see.</p>

Deluded by this absence of knowledge, or <span data-custom-style="Strong">ignorance</span>, they perform certain intentional acts, also known as karma. At death, driven along by craving, these <span data-custom-style="Strong">willful actions</span> direct the being’s <span data-custom-style="Strong">consciousness</span> into a next life—in part through guilt and rejoicing over past actions, in part through acts of the will arising around the time of death itself. The being’s actions influence where they take rebirth and thereby also shape <span data-custom-style="Strong">the individual’s immaterial aspects and body</span>, with the ‘immaterial aspects’ being general features of the being’s “inner world”. When beings are born, there are <span data-custom-style="Strong">the six senses</span>, the five physical ones plus the mind. When these senses are aware of things, there are <span data-custom-style="Strong">sense impressions</span>, which result in pleasant, painful, and neutral <span data-custom-style="Strong">sensations</span>. As long as there still is ignorance, <span data-custom-style="Strong">craving</span> arises to experience certain sensations and avoid others. Such cravings will continue at the time of death, when it becomes the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">fuel</span> for rebirth. Or, from a different perspective, out of craving beings <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">take up</span> the five aspects of existence again. This <span data-custom-style="Strong">fuel/taking up</span> causes a next <span data-custom-style="Strong">existence</span> after death and a resultant <span data-custom-style="Strong">birth</span> in a next life. Once the being is born, there is <span data-custom-style="Strong">suffering, including old age and death</span>. But when the being gets enlightened, ignorance and craving disappear, and the whole chain collapses. Then suffering will come to an end at death, when all experiences cease as the six senses disappear.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All this can happen because there is no solid essence in any part of existence, no self involved in any of the links. This absence of a self (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anatta</span>) is not explicitly mentioned in the standard sequences, but it is always implied. It is explained in many discourses on Dependent Arising, and is of utmost importance for a correct understanding of it. However, it is not the focus here, so I will discuss it only in passing, primarily in Chapter 12 to explain why the cessation of existence (including consciousness) is not the annihilation of an essence.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To better illustrate the functions of the twelve factors, the table below displays them alongside the standard truth on the origin of suffering, the craving that leads to a next life. (‘Next life’ translates <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puna-bhava</span>, more literally ‘re-existence’.) Since words are fluid but tables are not, this overview may box in some of the factors a bit too strictly. For example, the factor of existence is not just part of the rebirth process, it also continues after birth. The same applies to consciousness and the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. But the table can serve as a useful general overview, as will similar tables that are to follow.</p>

<p>The sequence from craving down to suffering I call the ‘craving sequence’ and all preceding factors the ‘ignorance sequence’. These two sequences function side by side in the creation of a next life. Both contain factors pertaining to rebirth, which means the twelvefold sequence describes the process of rebirth twice, illustrating the same process from two different angles. This is useful, because it lets us reflect upon the origin and cessation of suffering in multiple ways. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Visuddhimagga</span> says the two are different ways of teaching which are suitable for different people.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> To generalize, we might say the ignorance sequence focuses on the ethical and cognitive aspects, the craving sequence on the emotional and existential ones.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The double inclusion of the process of birth in the full sequence fits the Buddha’s inquiry in §11: “They are <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">born</span>, age, die, pass on, and are <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">reborn</span> again.” It also emphasizes that every birth is a <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">re</span>birth. It is often assumed that in the Buddha’s India everybody believed in rebirth, but the discourses regularly mention the materialistic view of a single lifetime. This could have prompted the Buddha to describe the process of birth twice in the sequence, clarifying that it is about rebirth.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Possible-development-of-the-twelvefold-sequence'>Possible development of the twelvefold sequence</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Later chapters will repeatedly show that there are indeed two parallel descriptions of rebirth in the twelvefold sequence, but the link between sensations and craving already hints that at this place two shorter sequences may have been joined together. Take the statement, “if sensations cease, craving will cease”. While this may theoretically be true, the actual way to end craving is not through ending sensations. Craving can only be ended through wisdom, through removing ignorance. The link between sensations and craving therefore seems a little artificial, possibly inserted to connect the two shorter sequences into the twelvefold one.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Based on various other grounds, many scholars have come to similar conclusions.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Tilmann Vetter for example concluded: “Two different chains of dependent origination of suffering were superficially combined into the twelvefold chain. The first part (links 1–7) [the ignorance sequence] is a more developed attempt at explaining the origin of suffering than the second part.”<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Franz Bernhard likewise thought: “It is noticeable that factors 8–12 [the craving sequence] are just a further elaboration of the basic idea of the four noble truths. […] Originally the Buddha identified only thirst [i.e. craving] as the cause of rebirth […] later—apparently influenced by and in controversy with competing contemporary systems—came then the rationale for rebirth through <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">avidyā</span>, ignorance.”<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Text-critical evidence for such a possible development comes from three Chinese parallels to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> They all start with the craving sequence beginning at old age and death, later mention a sequence going from craving down to consciousness, but never combine the two into the longer ninefold sequence found in the Pāli version, which goes straight from old age and death down to consciousness. See the table below, where for sake of comprehensiveness I also added the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Dīrgha Āgama</span> parallel to the same sutta, which contains all twelve factors.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>As another indication for the combination of the two parallel sequences, one Pāli discourse joins the craving sequence in its cessation mode to part of the ignorance sequence in its origination mode. In this discourse the cessation of craving does not depend on the cessation of feeling, as in the default sequence.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what is the cessation of suffering? A sight-consciousness arises dependent on the sense of sight and sights. The combination of the three is a sense impression. Dependent on sense impressions, there are sensations. Dependent on sensations, there is craving. But if craving completely fades away and ceases, fuel/taking up will cease. If fuel/taking up ceases, existence will cease. If existence ceases, birth will cease. And if birth ceases, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress, will cease. That is how this whole mass of suffering ceases. That is the cessation of suffering.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Discourses such as this may have been precursors to the standard twelvefold sequence. I do not wish to discuss the possible development of this sequence further here, however, as such analysis quickly becomes overly speculative. My point is simply that it is one piece of evidence for seeing two parallel descriptions of rebirth in the twelvefold sequence. And to clarify, unlike some scholars I do not mean to suggest the twelvefold sequence, or any other version of Dependent Arising in the Pāli Canon, was devised by someone other than the Buddha.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>When the twelve factors of Dependent Arising are seen to contain two parallel sequences, craving and ignorance together become the primary causes for rebirth.

<p>The close connection between ignorance and craving also presents itself in the phrase ‘obstructed by ignorance and chained by craving’ (or ‘hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving’).

We can therefore also contemplate the fundamental principles of Dependent Arising by considering only the five “bricks” of the craving sequence, as in the following illustration. This can be pragmatically relevant, since the ignorance sequence contains some terms which can be hard to relate to (particularly <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>) while the craving sequence may be more readily understood.</p>

<p>The hand that pulls out the brick of craving I labeled ‘wisdom’ to emphasize craving cannot be removed by an act of will or by simply being mindful. It requires deep insights into the nature of life. Craving itself depends on ignorance, on not seeing reality as it is. We will always desire existence as long as we think there is some sort of real happiness to be found in it, as long as we don’t understand what suffering is. That is why the Buddha said:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Mendicants, I mentioned you can find no beginning to the craving for existence, such that before that, there was no craving for existence, and after that, it came into being.

<p>Since craving depends on ignorance, yet another way to depict Dependent Arising as a tower of bricks is with a stick between ignorance and craving, as illustrated next. It is another way to think about the two parallel sequences.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I fear this illustration may be confusing, so let me explain. As long as ignorance stays in place, there will be craving; as long as there is ignorance and craving, there will be rebirth; and as long as there is rebirth, there will be suffering. The only way to end the problem is by removing ignorance, because it is the only brick with a string to pull. If you remove ignorance, then craving will cease, and as a result rebirth and suffering will too.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Please know that the illustration is limited by nature, and also do not think of it as a causal sequence working up from the bottom. There are not two separate rebirths, for example, even though the word ‘rebirth’ is included twice. The two bricks labeled as such are in reality not different rebirth processes. In a sense we might even say they are part of the same brick. The same applies to the two bricks labeled ‘suffering’, and to ignorance and craving, which may be seen as the combined root for rebirth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With that in mind, let me give one last tower analogy. We can also think of the twelve factors of Dependent Arising like this:</p>

Figure 7. The two parallel sequences as one stack of bricks</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To briefly clarify, craving and ignorance are the fundamental problems. Together they underlie the more active defilements of willful actions and taking up. At death, the will causes the (re)taking up of the five aggregates, which leads to the continuation of consciousness into a next existence. This results in a birth in the respective realm, producing the immaterial aspects and body along with the six senses. Having six senses, there will be old age and death and all other suffering: all the sensations that come from sense impressions.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> That is how the two parallel sequences function together to create suffering.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But if there is no ignorance, there will be no craving either. Lacking them, there are also no (defiled) willful actions, which include taking up. Without the propulsive power of those, there will not be another existence and no consciousness continuing after death. Then there is no next birth, and therefore also no immaterial aspects &amp; body, and no six senses. Having no six senses, there are no sense impressions, no sensations, and therefore no suffering. And, as the Buddha would say, that is how this whole mass of suffering ceases.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The idea of there being two parallel descriptions of rebirth in the twelvefold sequence, which is also the fundamental interpretation of the Pāli commentaries, is in modern times often called the ‘three-lifetime model’. But this term is confusing and possibly ill-informed, because as explained, the factors can also span just two lives, with ignorance and craving working together in the creation of a single rebirth. To explain the general principles the commentaries give a specific <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">example</span> of how the factors can span three lives, but the model is not limited to this, as the commentaries themselves also make very clear. Bhikkhu Bodhi explains: “The [commentarial] distribution into three lives is only an expository device which, for the sake of concision, has to resort to abstraction and oversimplification.”<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> None of the factors are limited to one particular life either. For instance, unenlightened beings were ignorant in the past life and still are in the current one, and as a consequence they suffer in the current life and will continue to do so in the next. It does not mean that ignorance only existed in the past life and suffering only in the future one. One would think this goes without saying, but it is a perennial misunderstanding of the model.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I hope the tower-of-bricks analogy in its various forms made the abstract idea of dependency a bit more tangible. However, it has its limits, like all analogies, and it does oversimplify some things. Most significantly, it paints a very static picture which fails to convey that rebirth is an active process. It does not properly depict the propulsive forces behind rebirth, the tendencies of the mind to move on to a next life, which are present primarily in the factors of willful actions and taking up. To offset this, Chapter 10 is dedicated to these factors. For now, with a preliminary understanding of Dependent Arising, we can turn to our main sutta, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>, and start investigating the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But before we do, I want to pause for one more moment to provide some perspective, because we will dive in the deep end and rarely get back to the shallows. We will discuss some of the factors in Dependent Arising that are most enigmatic, primarily those of willful actions, consciousness, and the immaterial aspects and body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>). It will take us into technical details, obscure texts, linguistic aspects of Pāli, and some hotly debated passages, all of which might make it seem like those who do not study a lot, have no chance of understanding Dependent Arising. But this is far from the truth. Real insights will come from meditation, not from study. The technical observations made here are not necessary to arrive at these insights.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Still, the Buddha taught Dependent Arising for good reasons. As long as we are able to appreciate some of the cultural and textual complications, there are some important lessons to be learned from every link in the chain. The following chapters will hopefully help unravel some of these complications and thereby shed some light not only on the Buddha’s teachings but also on the nature of life itself.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As explained in the previous chapter, the twelve factors of Dependent Arising should not be read in a vacuum. They have to be interpreted in a larger context, otherwise it is all too easy to misunderstand what they are about. It would be like visiting only the final lecture of a university course, when the professor summarizes all that he taught that semester, using terms that were defined in earlier lectures.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To give a concrete example, the factors of ‘birth’, ‘old age’, and ‘death’ are sometimes interpreted to refer to the constant arising and passing away of certain mind states or of a sense of self.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> But that the Buddha did not have this in mind quickly becomes apparent once his definitions of these terms are considered. These definitions occur at least seven times in the Nikāyas, including in texts with such names as <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">The Analysis of the Truths</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">The Discourse on Right View</span>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta,</span> the connected discourses on Dependent Arising, they occur four times:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what is old age and death? The old age of all kinds of beings in any order of beings—them being old, having broken teeth, gray hair, wrinkled skin, decreased vitality, and failing faculties: that is what’s called old age. The passing on of all kinds of beings from any order of beings—their passing away, deceasing, dying, death, demise, the end of their life, their aspects of existence breaking up, them laying down the body: that is what’s called death. The two taken together, that is what’s called old age and death.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what is birth? The birth of all kinds of beings into whatever order of beings—them being born, their conception, their production, their aspects of existence manifesting, them obtaining the sense faculties: that is what’s called birth.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It should be needless to say that states of mind don’t have broken teeth or gray hair, and are not the laying down of the body.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another important text to consider is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Great Discourse on the Sources [of Things]</span>,<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> which is the most detailed discourse on Dependent Arising in the Pāli Canon. It explains the connection between birth and death as follows:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Ānanda, I said old age and death depend on birth, which is to be understood as follows: If there were completely and utterly no birth at all, not of anyone anywhere—not of gods into the state of gods, not of celestials, not of spirits, not of ghosts, not of human beings, not of quadrupeds, not of birds, not of creepy-crawlies into the state of creepy-crawlies—not of any beings into any state. Then, with the total absence and cessation of birth, would old age and death occur?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“No, sir.”<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another relevant discourse is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahāpadāna Sutta</span>, where the Buddha tells the story of the bodhisattva Vipassī leaving his palace in a chariot. (This story in later centuries got mistaken to be about Gotama’s own life.)<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a> On his travels, Vipassī met an old person, a sick person, and a dead person. On coming back to his palace he said: “Curse this thing called birth! For old age, sickness, and death will come to those who are born.” He soon thereafter wondered, just like Gotama in §11: “People have really gotten into trouble. They are born, age, die, pass on, and are reborn again. Yet they don’t see any escape from this suffering, this old age and death and so on. When will an escape from all this finally be found?”<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> This question resulted in Vipassī’s insights into Dependent Arising, which also shows that birth, old age, and death are not states of mind or other momentary processes.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But this might have been less clear if we only considered the words themselves and not the way they are used. It’s an example of using context to determine the meaning of words. Instead of focusing on single words, we should look at the canon as a whole. Unfortunately, things are not as obvious with the factors of ‘willful actions’, ‘consciousness’, and ‘the individual’s immaterial aspects and body’, but this makes it even more important to consider as many relevant contexts as possible. Although these factors are not as clearly defined, their role in Dependent Arising is clarified in many discourses, including the one we’re primarily concerned with, the If There is Desire Discourse, which I will introduce after a note on the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-meaning-of-bhava'>The meaning of bhava</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Earlier I said my interpretation of Dependent Arising differs a little from tradition. For all intents and purposes this is only true for the factor of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>, which I translate dependent on context as ‘existence’ or ‘state of existence’. It basically means a life in a certain place, the continuance of existence after death in a certain realm. The Pāli commentaries include in this factor both rebirth into a next existence and the karma leading to that next existence, although they do so inconsistently.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> I do not think the inclusion of karma has any basis in the early texts and agree with Eviatar Shulman: “<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Bhava</span> probably [just] means a state of existence, a rebirth as a creature in any one of the different realms. Such a reading of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> has been suggested by numerous scholars.”<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> One of these scholars, Lambert Schmithausen, more directly stated that the interpretation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> as karma is alien to the early discourses and from their perspective can safely be disregarded.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> Venerable Bodhi also notes at the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bhava Sutta</span>: “What is meant [by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>] is a concrete state of individual existence in one of the three realms”,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a> which are the sensual, form, and formless realms. This is in accordance with how <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> is defined in context of Dependent Arising.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This interpretation also finds ancient support. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Arthaviniścaya Sūtra</span> is a Sanskrit early text which in its section on Dependent Arising first explains the factor of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> as occurring in three realms, just like the Pāli discourses, but then subdivides these realms further. Under the sensual realm it mentions animals, human beings, and lower gods, among others beings; under the form realm it mentions the gods of the Brahmā realm and higher; and under the formless realm it mentions the gods that spend their whole life span in one of the four formless states.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Madhyama Āgama</span> parallel to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> likewise explains the link between existence (有) and birth by saying that there is existence of fish in the state of fish, birds in that of birds, and so forth.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> The idea appears to be that the being first has to come to a certain realm before being physically born there. A curious but illuminating sutta in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span> confirms this when stating that certain highly developed non-returners will still obtain existence but not birth.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> They are said to attain full extinguishment (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>) “in between”, which means in a state of existence after death but before taking a proper rebirth.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Venerable Nāgārjuna, who held the same general interpretation of Dependent Arising as this book, wrote in the second century that for the liberated one there will be no further existence and that “existence (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>) is the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>”.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> Nāgārjuna’s view is well-supported by the Pāli Canon. For example, Uttara says in the Therāgātha:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>No state of existence (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>) is permanent,<br>

and pass away, one time after another.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is also said that a being after death gets reborn in a certain state of existence (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava-upapatti</span>).<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Ratana Sutta</span> states the stream enterer won’t have an eighth <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>, meaning an eighth life.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a> At least one discourse further says that all <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> only ends at the death of an enlightened being,<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a> which also disproves the common idea that it means some momentary “becoming” that ends at enlightenment.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discourses in many other ways indicates that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> means existence, not karma or becoming,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a> but since this difference in interpretation is not of too much concern for the current discussion on consciousness, I will leave it at this.

<p>Even though this discourse serves as an explanation of Dependent Arising, it is by no means the clearest text on the topic. It can be puzzling at first, so the remainder of this book will explain it in detail, finishing with my interpretation of the simile of the light beam.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To start, like most if not all suttas on Dependent Arising, the If There is Desire Discourse primarily concerns rebirth. That is why the Buddha said the four nutriments support those to be reborn.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a> These four nutriments also maintain beings who are already born, which is most obvious in the case of the nutriment of edible food. Stop eating, and you’ll die. This is even the case for enlightened beings. However, as its title suggests, the If There is Desire Discourse is not about eating food, but about <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">desiring</span> food, and this desire is what will lead to being reborn.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If at death there still is desire for the four nutriments, the discourse says, it results in rebirth. To abbreviate: “If there is desire, enjoyment, and craving […], existence in a future life is produced.” This is just a rephrasing of second truth of the noble one, which says the origin of suffering is “the craving that leads to a next life, which, along with enjoyment and desire, looks for happiness in various realms”. Notice the identical terms ‘craving’, ‘enjoyment’, and ‘desire’. Also found in both statements is the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">punabbhava</span>, which I normally translate as ‘next life’, but the expression <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ayatiṁ punabbhava</span> I translate as ‘existence in a future life’. This expression is elsewhere equated to “lying in a womb in the future”.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This table not only further clarifies that the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> is about rebirth, it also is an indication that the craving and ignorance sequences indeed function in parallel, as was presumed when they were first introduced. The discourse takes an alternative route through the standard factors, namely: craving (8) › consciousness (3) › the individual’s immaterial aspects and body (4) › existence (10) › birth (11) › suffering (12).<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a> It therefore shifts from the craving sequence to the ignorance sequence and back, showing that these two sequences are different ways to describe the same process. (The development of willful actions in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> is not equal to the willful actions of the ignorance sequence, though. It is the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">development</span>, the outcome, of willful actions, not the actions themselves. I’ll return to this.)</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Conception'>Conception</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>That the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> is about rebirth can also be derived from the sentence, “where consciousness is planted and sprouts, there is a conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body”. Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi rightly concluded that this means “the arrival of the current of consciousness from the past existence into the new one [resulting in] the arising of a new psychophysical organism at conception”.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a> Here ‘conception’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">avakkanti</span>) means the kind that happens at a pregnancy. The word is also used in the definition of ‘birth’ (§20) and in the largest discourse on Dependent Arising in the Pāli Canon, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, which mentions the conception of consciousness together with the immaterial aspects and body <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">in the mother’s womb</span> (§84). In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sampasādanīya Sutta</span> the Buddha also mentions conception in the mother’s womb, as does Raṭṭhapāla in the Therāgāthā. The nun Isidāsī likewise describes having been conceived in the wombs of various animals.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a> ‘Conception’ clearly refers to the process of birth here.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another reference to pregnancy in context of Dependent Arising occurs in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>[…] there is a conception of a fetus. When there is a conception, there are the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. Dependent on the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, there are the six senses. Dependent on the six senses, sense impressions. [And so on.]<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">avakkanti</span> is also clarified by the Pāli Canon’s second-largest text on Dependent Arising, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving</span>, which also mentions the conception of a fetus. It describes the birth of a child who, if he remains attached to sensations, will be reborn again. So there are two subsequent births in this passage, just like in the default sequence of Dependent Arising.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Mendicants, a fetus is conceived (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">avakkanti</span>) when there is a combination of three things. No fetus is conceived when the mother is not in her fertile period, even though there is coitus of the mother and father, and a spirit to be reborn is awaiting. Nor is a fetus conceived when no spirit to be reborn is awaiting, even though the mother is in her fertile period, and there is coitus of the mother and father. But when there is coitus of the mother and father, the mother is in her fertile period, and a spirit to be reborn is awaiting, a fetus is conceived.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The mother then carries the fetus inside her womb for nine or ten months: a heavy burden, causing much anxiety. After those nine or ten months she gives birth: another heavy burden, causing much anxiety. When the infant is born she nourishes it with her own blood, for mother’s milk is called ‘blood’ in the training of the Noble One.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The boy grows up and his faculties mature. He plays children’s games such as somersaults, tipcat, pinwheels, toy ploughs, toy weights, toy carts, and toy bows. The boy grows up further and his faculties mature further. He amuses himself, being well supplied and provided with the objects of the five senses: sights cognized with the sense of sight, sounds cognized with the sense of hearing, smells cognized with the sense of smell, flavors cognized with the sense of taste, and tangibles cognized with the sense of touch, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and alluring.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When he sees sights with the sense of sight, he gets attracted to pleasing ones and becomes averse to displeasing ones. He does not practice recollection of the body. He has a restricted mind, and does not accurately understand where those bad, unwholesome qualities completely cease: the liberation of the mind and liberation through understanding. Favoring and opposing in that way, whatever sensations he feels—whether pleasant, painful, or neutral—he enjoys, welcomes, and keeps holding on to them. It results in enjoyment, and when there is enjoyment of sensations, there is fuel/taking up. Dependent on fuel/taking up, existence. Dependent on existence, birth. And dependent on birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates. [Similar for the sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of taste, the sense of touch, and the mind.]<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a></p>

<p>As a sidenote, ‘spirit to be reborn’ translates <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span>. The term is rarely used in this context, and its meaning has been a matter of some debate.<a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a> The commentary understands it to refer to the being to be reborn. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Ekottarika Āgama</span> parallel uses ‘external consciousness’ (外識),<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> which must refer to the being’s consciousness that has not yet entered the womb, similar to the description of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> (§84). This is what in part makes Venerable Anālayo “allow for an identification of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span> with the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>” of Dependent Arising.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a> In a similar context in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Assalāyana Sutta</span>, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span> is said to be either a ruler, brahmin, merchant, or worker.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Madhyama Āgama</span> parallel clarifies that this refers to their past life and refers to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span> as “the one to be born”.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a> After an analysis of the term in both Buddhist and Vedic contexts, Wijesekera also concluded: “The term was deliberately employed by early Buddhism, perhaps for the first time in the religious history of India, to denote the ‘surviving factor’ in man.”<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a> The reason for the debate is that this conclusion has little connection with how the term is used in the rest of the canon, where it usually refers to a type of mythological heavenly being. I translate <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span> here in line with the Pāli commentaries and Āgamas, as ‘spirit to be reborn’. (In accepting <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">this</span> interpretation, however, I would add that it seems reasonable the spirit can also arrive a considerable time <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">after</span> the intercourse of the parents, or put differently, that ‘conception of the fetus’ does not refer to the biological fertilization of the egg but to a later point during gestation, namely the moment the spirit enters the womb.)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Regardless of what <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span> exactly means in this passage, its presence results in the conception of the fetus, which is followed by the arising of the sense faculties. Earlier the discourse also said, in line with the standard sequence of Dependent Arising, that the six senses are generated and brought about by the individual’s immaterial aspects and body.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a> So in the same text we have <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">fetus › six senses</span>, and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">immaterial aspects and body › six senses</span>. It is therefore logical to relate the immaterial aspects and body to the fetus also here, just as in §25, which said, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">fetus = immaterial aspects and body › the six senses</span>. In these instances, ‘fetus’ and ‘immaterial aspects and body’ are practically synonymous, both leading to the six senses.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The development of the fetus into the boy whose “faculties mature” can be seen as more or less equivalent to the immaterial aspects and body leading to the six senses in the standard sequence. As Vetter observed: “The six sense organs cannot start to function fully before the moment of birth. They may be seen as the result of the growth of a person (‘name and form’) in the mother’s womb.”<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The connection between the immaterial aspects &amp; body and the six senses is also clarified by the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, which skips the six senses in its list of factors and has sense impressions depend directly on the immaterial aspects and body; see <span data-custom-style="internal-reference">table 6</span>. The six senses, which, as Vetter said, are the sense “organs”, cannot reasonably be included under sense impressions. If we assume the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> describes the same basic principles as the default sequence—and there is no reason not to—they must therefore be included under <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a> This indicates that both the six senses and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> are part of the same thing, namely the being.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To summarize this section, the conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body in the If There is Desire Discourse is the same type of conception described in the other passages included in the above, which is that of a being.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As a final observation, although both the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> and the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving</span> specifically talk about human conception, this does not mean that the conception of the immaterial aspects and body always takes place in the human realm. Conception also happens for other beings, and also outside of wombs. Still, the Buddha’s teachings on Dependent Arising do tend to focus on human existence. The reason seems straightforward: most of his listeners were humans, who could relate to human birth more readily.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>You too are a human, and when reflecting on rebirth it may even be helpful to wonder how you arrived in this particular life, how you ended up in your mother’s womb. This is what the Buddha encourages his followers to do when he describes the psychic power of past life recollection: “You remember passing away from [the last life], and being reborn <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">here</span>.”<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a> Most of your current attachments are likely also in the human realm, encouraging future rebirth in a womb again. The child in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving</span> is not just any child: it represents the listener. Do you want to go through that process again? Being “a heavy burden, causing much anxiety” for yet another mother? Reflecting like this, these passages on fetuses and wombs, which at the surface might seem unpragmatic, start to become relevant.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Historical-context-of-“name-and-form”'>Historical context of “name and form”</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I have already deviated from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> quite a bit, intending to show that the conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>) refers to rebirth. Before returning to this discourse, in the remainder of this chapter I will further clarify this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. Erich Frauwallner found the interpretation of this term “offers no difficulties”,<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a> but I disagree, even though we arrived at similar conclusions. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nāmarūpa</span> is not an easy concept, because a rich cultural history lies behind it. It can be very unintuitive to us, especially when translated literally as ‘name and form’. It misses some of the ancient implications, but I prefer a more pragmatic and self-explanatory translation, ‘the individual’s immaterial aspects and body’, in part because in the Buddha’s time the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> would have been quite self-explanatory too. The Buddha had profound insights but always used everyday language to convey them.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was not invented by the Buddha. It also occurs in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>, and has precursors in the earlier Vedas. That does not necessarily make the term specific to the Brahmins, however. “It seems safe enough to assume that <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣadic</span> terminology represents more or less the prevalent verbal conventions of the age contemporary with and immediately prior to the time of the historical Buddha, and that the Buddha did not deviate from these conventions without a compelling cause”, thought Reat.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a> In other words, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> already had certain connotations to the Buddha’s contemporaries. He simply adopted this term from society—although not without some philosophical differences, as we’ll see.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>We no longer have the same connotations with “name and form”, which is why some clarification is required. Grammatically <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is a compound consisting of two words: <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>. It likely originated as a possessive adjective rather than noun, as Liudmila Olalde suggests in the excellent <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Zum Begriff ‘nāmarūpa’: das Individuum im Pāli-Kanon</span> (<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">On the concept ‘nāmarūpa’: the individual in the Pāli Canon</span>).<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a> That is to say, the word meant ‘<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">with</span> a name and form’ rather than ‘<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">the</span> name and form’. In Pāli it is common for such adjectives to be used as nouns also. This is like the English adjective ‘wise’ being used as a noun in ‘the wise’, meaning people with wisdom. Likewise, the compound <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to an individual being <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">with</span> a certain name (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>) and form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>).</p>
</div>

<p>As to the component of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>, in the suttas in general the word has a variety of meanings.

The word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> has this meaning in other places too. One discourse says, “the form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>) of mortals gets old”, and another says, “with reference to this body: this form is seen to be discarded [at death]”.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a> Yet another says the space enclosed by flesh and skin is called ‘form’.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a> Although <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> far from always refers to the body, it does mean the body in some instances, and one of these instances is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.

<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nāma</span>, which literally means ‘name’, will require a longer explanation. As part of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> the Pāli discourses define it as “sensation, perception, intention, sense impression, and attention”,<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a> which are subjective, immaterial parts of an individual’s experience, hence my translation ‘immaterial aspects’.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a> But this definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> may, and perhaps <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">should</span>, strike us as odd. Why would such parts of the being be called ‘name’?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To answer this question we have to take a detour from the Pāli Canon into the texts of the Brahmins. In those texts the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was used to refer to individual beings, who all had their own specific names and forms (or ‘visible appearances’, per <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Olivelle</span>). Their names and forms made beings distinguishable from others. In the Rig Veda, cows are said to differ from all other types of animals in appearance and also in name (‘cow’ instead of ‘horse’, say) but individual species of frogs can only be distinguished from one another by their appearance, not by name since they are all called ‘frog’.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</span> also shows that the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was used in ordinary speech to refer to individual beings. It describes how gods, humans, and other beings were created at the start of time, and then says:<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122" role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>At that time this world […] was distinguished simply in terms of name and visible appearance—“He is so and so by name and has this sort of an appearance.” So even today this world is distinguished simply in terms of name and visible appearance (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>), as when we say, “He is so and so by name and has this sort of an appearance.”<a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Other early <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span> also speak of “the name and form of beings”.<a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a> Even earlier, the Atharva Veda mentions the name and form of a man.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a> The Buddha used <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> similarly, to refer to individuals with their name and form.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Name-as-one’s-essence'>Name as one’s essence</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There is a more complex layer to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>, however, because there existed in society also a belief that the being’s name was an intrinsic part of that being. It was considered just as much a piece of them as their body, if not even more essential. The Buddha adopted the conventional term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> as a reference to individual beings, but not the belief that the name was part of the individual. His “definition” of ‘name’ as sensations, perceptions, and so forth, therefore was in all likelihood a skillful reinterpretation intended to challenge such beliefs, formed only after he already adopted the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> conventionally.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Let me clarify what sort of ideas the Buddha was replying to. In the thought-world of the time the name was generally considered an intrinsic part of the one who carried it. “A personal name is not different from the name bearer, on the contrary, it is an essential part of it”, found Olalde after an analysis of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in Brahmanic texts.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a> This notion was described more extensively by Jan Gonda:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Among students of comparative religion and cultural anthropology it is a matter of common knowledge that the name was widely regarded as an essential part of its bearer, as in a way identical with him; that it is “equivalent to his true existence” [quoting Eliade] or “is to be regarded as an essential part of his personality” [quoting Masani]. […] This belief obtained also in ancient India. Over and over again authors give evidence of their conviction that the connections between a name and its bearer, whether this is a person or a thing, is so intimate that there is for all practical purposes question of identity. […] Names are as essential a part of man’s personality as his physical strength, his organs, his life-breath.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127" role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The name “designates the whole character structure of man, perhaps because in ancient and archaic thought the name of a person magically incorporated its bearer’s personality”.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a> It was also believed to survive death, and to travel with the person to the afterlife. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</span>, the brahmin sage <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Yājñavalkya</span> is asked what doesn’t leave a person when he dies, and he answers, “his name”.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Such ideas about names are not unique to ancient India, nor are they merely theories of ancient texts. Anthropologist James George Frazer wrote in 1890:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Primitive man regards his name as a vital portion of himself and takes care of it accordingly. Thus, for example, the North American Indian regards his name, not as a mere label, but as a distinct part of his personality, just as much as are his eyes or his teeth, and believes that injury will result as surely from the malicious handling of his name as from a wound inflicted on any part of his physical organism. […] A Brahmin child receives two names, one for common use, the other a secret name which none but his father and mother should know. The latter is only used at ceremonies such as marriage. The custom is intended to protect the person against magic, since a charm only becomes effectual in combination with the real name.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130" role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>We can assume that many of these ideas were not unique to the Brahmins either. The belief that one’s name was an intrinsic part of one’s being likely prevailed throughout the Buddha’s India.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But for Brahmins the implications of names went further still. A Brahmin child was not fully recognized until given their (secret) name. Without a name they did not really exist as a person, because it was their name and form that separated beings from the shapeless, nameless universe, so Brahmins believed.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The naming of a child brings us back to conception and birth. Joanna Jurewicz wrote about a Brahmanic birth ritual “in the course of which the father accepted his son and gave him a name. By accepting his son, he confirmed his own identity with him; by giving him a name he took him out of the unnamed, unshaped chaos and finally created him.”<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131" role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a> The ritual, which was done to get a boy, started at the moment of intercourse. At this point in the process the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</span> contains a verse which is particularly interesting for our discussion, since it speaks of a fetus and forms in the mother’s womb. The father-to-be needed to recite this verse to his wife during intercourse in order to invoke the gods:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>May Viṣṇu prepare your womb,<br>
and Tvaṣṭṛ mold the forms;<br>
May Prajāpati impregnate you,<br>
and Dhātṛ lay the fetus in you.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132" role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The text continues. After ten lunar months the baby boy is born. Before he is allowed to drink his mother’s milk, the father has to give him a name, apparently whispering it into his ear to keep it secret. At this point the child was deemed truly “created”.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>So the Upaniṣads also contain a process of conception and birth, using the terms ‘womb’, ‘fetus’, ‘name’, and ‘form’—with the Sanskrit words all being equivalent to the Pāli: <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">yoni</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">garbha</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>, and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> respectively. There is a clear linguistic connection with Dependent Arising here, however distant, especially when we consider the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>’s passage on the conception of “name and form” in the mother’s womb. (§84) Jurewicz believes the connection could explain the Buddha’s choice of “the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> to denote an organism in which <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vijñāna</span> [consciousness] settles”,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133" role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a> although we should not assume he did so based on this Brahmanic ritual alone. The Buddha surely did not believe in the efficacy of the Brahmanic birth ritual, nor did he adopt the philosophy of one’s name being a part of one’s being. But he did use <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> in a similar fashion as the Brahmins. These words seem to have been a common way to refer to an individual.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-Buddha’s-definition-of-nāma'>The Buddha’s definition of nāma</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The belief that one’s name was an essential part of one’s being may have prompted the Buddha’s definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>, which he defined as sensation, perception, intention, sense impression, and attention. Initially he used the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> as it was used in common speech: to refer to the individual. The specific definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> was likely formed later. As Frauwallner observed: “The name, according to a very old idea, is a separate entity […] With the gradual development of the term ‘form’ […] the meaning of the idea ‘name’ also shifted. Thereunder were [by the Buddha] understood in contrast to corporeality the psychical factors [of sensation, perception, etc.]”<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134" role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Their name is something beings tend to identify with. It is something that “provides an abstract identity for the individual”,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135" role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a> something beings tend take to be ‘them’. But this type of identification is contrary to the Buddha’s view of reality. “The fact that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> could easily have been identified with the core of a person or with a component subsisting after death may explain why its reinterpretation became necessary”, concluded also Olalde.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136" role="doc-noteref"><sup>136</sup></a> The Buddha’s definition (or, rather, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">reinterpretation</span>) of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> was not meant as an exact classification of certain parts of the being, nor was it intended to pinpoint what ‘name’ exactly is. It was a way to tell people that their names were just impersonal things, a way to teach <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anatta</span>, the absence of self. Instead of telling them what ‘name’ <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">is</span>, the Buddha basically said, “this is how this thing we call ‘name’ should be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">looked at</span>” (that is, not as a self-like entity, but as made of sensation, perception, and so forth). The Buddha was a pragmatist. Rather than giving a textbook-style definition, he taught something people could use for contemplation.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But why did he use these specific five factors: sensation, perception, intention, sense impression, and attention? Contemporary interpreters have presented their thoughts on this as if they are canonical, but no early discourse actually gives an explanation. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Visuddhimagga</span>’s interpretation of ‘bending (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">namana</span>) towards things’ is based on a playful but false etymology of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and cannot be taken seriously.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137" role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Śāriputra Abhidharma</span> suggests that the factors take part in the mental process of naming things.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138" role="doc-noteref"><sup>138</sup></a> We might go along with this suggestion, as long as we keep in mind that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> does not mean ‘nam<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">ing</span>’ but ‘name’, particularly one’s proper name, like the one given at birth.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139" role="doc-noteref"><sup>139</sup></a> A name is a label, not a process. So sensation, perception, and so forth, were not meant to be what ‘name’ <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">is</span> but what <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">bring it about</span>. The Buddha was then saying that the name is not an innate part of the being but something arisen through processes like attention and perception. In other words, the names of beings in reality are nothing more than constructs formed by the mind based on its experiences.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Accepting this suggestion requires some assumptions, however, because no sutta says how or even <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">if</span> these five factors would be involved in such a process. At best a dense passage in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> on “designation contact” (§109) may hint at such ideas, but it leaves almost all of the factors of the definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> unmentioned. So on the basis of the earliest texts this idea has to remain speculative.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As will be discussed later, consciousness is said to be dependent on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. With this in mind, let me propose another possible reason for the specific factors in the definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>. It could be that the factors emphasize specific things consciousness depends on.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140" role="doc-noteref"><sup>140</sup></a> Some passages say it relies on sense impressions and mental engagement (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samannāhāra</span>), a synonym for attention; it also relies on sensations and perception, which are intrinsically linked with it; and in the default sequence of Dependent Arising it is preceded by willful actions, which is synonymous with intentions.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141" role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a> This neatly covers all five factors. Other conditions for consciousness, such as the physical senses, may then perhaps be included under <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But whatever the Buddha’s exact intentions behind the definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> may have been, this definition is only a minor teaching in the suttas, one which plays no critical role in the standard teachings on Dependent Arising, where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> conventionally refers to the individual. The definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>, whatever its exact implications, is only a secondary layer on top of this, likely intended to challenge ideas about names being an intrinsic part of the being.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Pāli <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span> had lost contact with the ancient ideas about names and, with its aim to categorize phenomena into systematic frameworks, started defining <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> more strictly. It did so differently than the suttas, in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Dhammasaṅgaṇī</span> as the four non-form aggregates of sensation, perception, will, and consciousness; see <span data-custom-style="internal-reference">table 7</span>.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142" role="doc-noteref"><sup>142</sup></a> Richard Gombrich said about this: “The later Buddhist tradition did not understand how the Buddha had appropriated this term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>. Realizing that at this point in the chain [of Dependent Arising] there should be a reference to the emergence of the individual person, and knowing that the Buddha identified the person with the five khandhas, the tradition made <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarupa</span> equivalent to the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>” (with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> encompassing four of them, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> being the fifth).<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143" role="doc-noteref"><sup>143</sup></a> Gombrich then correctly states that the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span>’s definition is not in accordance with the suttas, where the consciousness is always separate from <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. This definition seems to be relatively early, though, for it was also used by the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sarvāstivādins</span> in the Saṁyukta Āgama, who thus shared the same general interpretation as the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Theravādins</span>.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144" role="doc-noteref"><sup>144</sup></a></p>

<p>An earlier layer of the Pāli <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span>, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Vibhaṅga</span>, defined <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> only as three aspects of existence: sensation, perception, and will.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145" role="doc-noteref"><sup>145</sup></a> While this definition still differs from the suttas, by omitting consciousness it aligns better with the sutta definition. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Vibhaṅga</span> realized that the aspect of existence of will (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>) is effectively equal to intention. The Majjhima Nikāya commentary further suggests that alongside intention, sense impression and attention should also be seen as part of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146" role="doc-noteref"><sup>146</sup></a> This seems to me somewhat of a stretch, but with intention being equivalent to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>, the Buddha’s definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> does contain three of the five aspects of existence (sensation and perception being the other two). And since <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> also includes the aspect of existence of form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>), the compound functionally contains four of the five aspects of existence. From a pragmatic perspective the arising of consciousness along with the individual’s immaterial aspects and body is therefore equivalent to the arising of the five aspects of existence—which, as mentioned before, refers to the birth of the individual person.</p>

<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Śāriputra Abhidharma</span>, which according to Frauwallner has an ancient core, seems to define <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">nāma</span> with the same factors as the Pāli suttas, as do some parallels in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Ekottarika Āgama</span>.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147" role="doc-noteref"><sup>147</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Paṭisambhidāmagga</span>, an early Pāli commentary, defines it with these factors as well, although it also adds some other observations.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148" role="doc-noteref"><sup>148</sup></a> This definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> seems to be the earliest one, in part also because it is the most difficult reading.

<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> part of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is defined by the Buddha as, “the four elements, along with form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>) derived from the four elements”.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149" role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a> Like other ancient civilizations, the Indians believed that the world was made of the elements of earth, water, fire, and air. Unfortunately, the suttas never directly explain what the form <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">derived from</span> these four elements is,<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150" role="doc-noteref"><sup>150</sup></a> and the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span>’s explanation seems way too contrived. I understand the elements to be the abstract qualities of solidity, fluidity, heat, and movement, and the form derived from them to be specific manifestations of these qualities, such as rocks, water droplets, or flames—or in the case of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, the various parts of the body.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>A number of suttas tell us that physical form can be internal or external.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151" role="doc-noteref"><sup>151</sup></a> <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">The Longer Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint</span> explains that internal form is parts of the body, such as bones and skin in the case of the element of earth, and saliva and sweat in the case of the element of water. External form is things outside of the person, such as the water in the ocean in the case of the element of water, and a fire in a village in the case of the element of fire.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152" role="doc-noteref"><sup>152</sup></a> We have seen that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in the standard sequence of Dependent Arising refers to the being, which means that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> here refers to the internal (or ‘personal’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ajjhattaṁ</span>) elements, not the external.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This is akin to how the factor of the six senses (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saḷāyatana</span>) refers to the internal six sense faculties of the eyes, ears, and so on, not to the external objects of sights, sounds, etc. Although in some texts the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saḷāyatana</span> encompasses both the senses <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">and</span> their objects, as a factor of Dependent Arising it is specifically defined as the senses only, excluding the objects. To illustrate, the Analysis of the Six Sense Spheres says:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>I said the six internal senses should be comprehended. What did I mean by that? The sense of sight (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cakkhāyatana</span>),<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153" role="doc-noteref"><sup>153</sup></a> the sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of taste, the sense of touch, and the mind. […]</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>I said the six external sense objects should be comprehended. What did I mean by that? Sights (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpāyatana</span>), sounds, smells, flavors, tangibles, and mental phenomena.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154" role="doc-noteref"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>And the Analysis of Dependent Arising says:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what are the six senses (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saḷāyatana</span>)? The sense of sight (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">cakkhāyatana</span>), the sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of taste, the sense of touch, and the mind.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155" role="doc-noteref"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This shows that the external sense objects are not part of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saḷāyatana</span> in Dependent Arising.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156" role="doc-noteref"><sup>156</sup></a> While sometimes the six sense faculties are specifically called ‘internal’, when <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saḷāyatana</span> is used as a factor of Dependent Arising, it is assumed that the audience understands it refers to these internal senses, not to external objects. The same applies to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>: it is not specifically said to refer to the internal elements that compose the being’s physical form, but context indicates that it does. The water of the ocean and fires in a village do not exist in the mother’s womb, for example.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I mentioned that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> is defined as the four elements. Direct connections between the body and the four elements are also made throughout the Nikāyas. A common phrase says “this body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kāya</span>) consists of form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>), is made up of the four elements”.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Satippaṭṭhāna Sutta</span> instructs meditators to look at their body as consisting of the four elements, like a butcher might look at the various cuts of a cow.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158" role="doc-noteref"><sup>158</sup></a> This instruction aims to remove attachment to the body. This also seems to be the primary intent behind the definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> in context of Dependent Arising. Earlier I argued that the Buddha’s definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> is not an exact classification of parts of the being but a means to contemplate the absence of a self. With <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> the situation is similar. Its definition is not a metaphysical statement on what ‘form’ really is, but a way to contemplate that the body is a part of nature. As with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>, the Buddha is not saying “this is what I <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">mean</span> by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>” but “this is how this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> should be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">looked at</span>”. We should look at the body as made of the elements, of aspects of nature that we do not own and cannot control.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>According to Hamilton, this is also why the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> is used rather than <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kāya</span> (body): “It stresses that the body is comprised of a group of processes which are classified according to four kinds of characteristics [of] solidity, fluidity, heat, and motion, [which] allows the reader to gain more understanding of how the body is constituted in a way the designation <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kāya</span> does not.”<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159" role="doc-noteref"><sup>159</sup></a> I would add that in our day and age we might prefer to look at the body as made of chemical elements or atoms. This would serve the same function as the Buddha’s definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>, at least in this context. (I should note again that the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> can have other connotations which do not apply in the current context.)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Considering the Buddha’s pragmatism, ‘definition’ may even be a wrong way to think about these things. Instead of strict, technical classifications, we are dealing with didactics (ways of teaching), not only in the case of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> but also for some of the other factors. Consider craving:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what is craving? There are six kinds of craving: craving for sights, craving for sounds, craving for smells, craving for flavors, craving for tangibles, and craving for mental phenomena. That is what’s called craving.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If the Buddha meant to explain what craving exactly <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">is</span>, we would be better helped with synonyms for craving or with an explanation of how it functions. This list tells us absolutely nothing about what craving is. But it does remind us of the things we crave <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">for</span>, and that is helpful. We encountered a similar case already at §2: the definition of consciousness as consisting of six types. It doesn’t really tell us what consciousness exactly is, but it tells us what things we can be conscious of. When the Buddha concludes this definition with, “that is what’s called consciousness”, in this case it means something like, “what you call ‘consciousness’ in reality is this”—which is to say, it is not a homogeneous entity that underlies all experience, but something made up of six different types of consciousness. Similarly, the definitions of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> are to be seen as didactic tools.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-space">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To summarize the main ideas of this chapter, the factor of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the individual, and its two components represent certain aspects of that individual, which is why I translate it as ‘the individual’s immaterial aspects and body’. These things exist throughout the being’s entire lifespan, but their <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">arising</span> refers specifically to the start of life, to the being’s conception. The Buddha adapted the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣadic</span> Brahmins, or more likely from general society, to whom it meant the individual with their visible form and intrinsic name. His definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> was meant to challenge traditional ideas about names being part of oneself, and his definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> meant to challenge attachments to the body.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To close this chapter properly, it has to be noted that although the oldest use of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was a referent for individual beings,<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160" role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a> it was also used for individual <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">objects</span>. “The essence of a thing was expressed in its name and its visible appearance”, wrote Patrick Olivelle in the introduction to his translations of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>, with ‘thing’ meaning a person or an object.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161" role="doc-noteref"><sup>161</sup></a> This philosophy seems to have resulted at least in part from the belief that objects had within them the essence of divine beings that bore their names. Campfires, for instance, as well as cooking fires, forest fires, and all other fires, were all considered to be part of the god Agni, whose name just means Fire. There was, to some Brahmins at least, no separation between the divine and the worldly, and hence also no clear boundary between the animate and inanimate. All bore intrinsic names and forms. But while <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to external objects with some regularity in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>, in the Pāli Canon the word is used in this fashion very rarely, and always outside the standard teachings on Dependent Arising. Because of the minor place of this so-called <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">external</span> name and form, its discussion can wait until <span data-custom-style="internal-reference">Chapter 9</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="internal-reference">Chapter 8</span> explains <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> further, particularly its dependency on consciousness. Now we have a basic understanding of the concept, we can return to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>, starting with the simile of the painting.</p>

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-simile-of-the-painting'>The simile of the painting</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To recall the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>It’s like an artist or painter producing a complete figure of a man or woman on a well-polished board, a wall, or a canvas, using dye, lac, turmeric, indigo, and crimson. If there is desire, enjoyment, and craving for the nutriment of edible food, then consciousness will get planted and will sprout [in a next life]. Where consciousness is planted and sprouts, there is a conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. Where there is a conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, willful actions develop [their results]. Where willful actions develop, existence in a future life is produced. Where existence in a future life is produced, there is future birth, old age, and death. Where there is future birth, old age, and death, there will be sorrow, anxiety, and distress, I tell you.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>If there is desire, enjoyment, and craving for the nutriment of sense impression … intention … consciousness, then consciousness will get planted and will sprout. […]<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162" role="doc-noteref"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Before turning to the actual simile, I want to address the order of the factors, which is as follows:</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Craving, desire, and enjoyment</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Planting of consciousness</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body</p>

<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Development of willful actions</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Production of existence in a future life</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Birth, followed by old age and death and other suffering</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the standard sequence of Dependent Arising, willful actions precede consciousness, but here they are mentioned later. On this basis the commentary concludes that factors 2 and 5 signify two separate rebirths, with the planting of consciousness being the start of one life and the production of existence being the start of another. But this approaches the text too analytically, not allowing any flexibility in the order of the terms. Factors 2 through 6 instead all refer to a single rebirth. The word ‘where’ should be understood as the place of rebirth (as the commentary does note correctly) and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">where</span> consciousness is reborn, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">there</span> the immaterial aspects and body are conceived, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">there</span> willful actions develop, and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">there</span> a future life is produced. These things happen more or less in tandem, not sequentially. The order of factors therefore does not signify anything out of the ordinary. More significantly, as some readers may already have noticed, the factor following consciousness is not just ‘willful actions’ but ‘the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">development</span> of willful actions’. This refers to the outcome of the actions, not the actions themselves. The outcome of willful actions is a specific rebirth with its attributes.</p>

<p>Regarding the simile of the painting, it is just a single line, but it contains a lot: “It’s like an artist or painter producing a complete figure of a man or woman on a well-polished board, a wall, or a canvas, using dye, lac, turmeric, indigo, and crimson.” This is a metaphor for how willful actions determine the quality of one’s birth and thereby one’s immaterial aspects and body.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163" role="doc-noteref"><sup>163</sup></a> In detail: the artist or painter (wholesome or unwholesome actions) produces a complete figure of a man or woman (an incarnation) on a board, wall, or canvas (the sensual, formed, or formless realm) using five paints (the five aspects of existence). Further, the word for ‘figure’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>) in “producing a complete figure of a man or woman” refers to the bodily part of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. Even ‘producing’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhinibbatti</span>) refers to rebirth. It is also used in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, which mentions the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">production</span> of the immaterial aspects and body in the mother’s womb;<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164" role="doc-noteref"><sup>164</sup></a> in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> itself in “existence in a future life is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">produced</span>”; and in the very definition of birth at §20.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Despite the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> mentioning future birth and the production of existence in a future life, some interpreters do not think the simile of the painting is about rebirth, believing it instead illustrates the formation of certain thought constructs or cognitions.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165" role="doc-noteref"><sup>165</sup></a> But there is a reason the painted figure is specifically a being, not a lifeless object like a bowl of fruit or a landscape: the simile specifically depicts the production of a next life. This is further clarified by the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Second Discourse on the Leash</span>, where the Buddha uses the same simile to describe the varieties of births beings produce within transmigration (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>):</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Mendicants, transmigration has no discernible beginning. You can find no beginning to the transmigration of beings who roam around obstructed by ignorance and chained by craving. Imagine a dog on a leash tied to a strong post or pillar. Whenever he would walk, stand, sit, or lie down, he would do so right beside that post or pillar. Likewise, unlearned ordinary people regard form to be them, to be theirs, to be their self. They regard sensation, perception, will, and consciousness to be them, to be theirs, to be their self. Whenever they walk, stand, sit, or lie down, they do so right along those five taken up aspects of existence. Therefore, you should regularly reflect upon your mind, thinking: ‘For a long time this mind has been contaminated with desire, anger, and delusion.’ Beings are contaminated because the mind is contaminated. They are purified when the mind is purified.</p>

<p>This is how I understand the primary messages of this sutta: Our minds have been defiled for a long time (meaning many lifetimes) and because of this we have been going through the cycle of birth and death for a long time. Throughout our journey, obstructed by ignorance and chained by craving, like a dog leashed to a pillar, we have been reborn as animals (probably even as dogs) and also in many other circumstances. But wherever we were reborn, life was always just the five aspects of existence, which we foolishly desired and mistakenly took to be ‘us’. Wherever we were reborn, we always reproduced these five aspects of existence and never went beyond them, like the dog can’t ever leave his pillar. The mind is responsible for creating all these various rebirths, just like painters are responsible for their paintings.</p>

<p>The preceding sutta in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Saṁyutta Nikāya</span>, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">First Discourse on the Leash</span>, also clarifies these ideas. It specifically says that if one keeps circling like a dog around the five aspects of existence, one is not liberated from <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">birth</span>.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168" role="doc-noteref"><sup>168</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As a sidenote, the name of the picture ‘Wandering’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">caraṇa</span>) can also be translated as ‘Conduct’. About this picture the commentary says, in Venerable Bodhi’s translation: “The Sankha were a sect of heretical Brahmins. Having taken a canvas, they had various pictures painted on it of the good and bad destinations to illustrate success and failure, and then they took it around on their wanderings.

<p>Much more could be said about this discourse, which is also full of puns that don’t show in translation, but my point here is merely that the simile of the painting refers to the creation of rebirth in this discourse, and therefore it also does in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>. This in turn tells us something about the simile of the light beam in that same discourse, namely that it is about the cessation of rebirth.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Just as the quality of a painting is determined by the skill of its painter, the quality of a being’s rebirth is determined by the moral wholesomeness of the actions performed throughout their life. To simplify, like bad painters make ugly paintings and good painters make beautiful ones, bad actions lead to bad rebirths and good actions to good ones. This chapter discusses how this principle relates to the factors of willful actions and consciousness.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As the title of this section indicates, I will show here that willful actions are a synonym (or near synonym) for karma.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170" role="doc-noteref"><sup>170</sup></a> This may already be known and accepted by most readers, but it bears repeating, for many non-traditional interpretations of Dependent Arising err here.</p>

<p>Given the direct connection with Dependent Arising in these verses and elsewhere,<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172" role="doc-noteref"><sup>172</sup></a> deeds should fit somewhere in the twelvefold scheme, and the primary if not only candidate is willful actions. (By ‘willful’ I mean ‘intentional/volitional’, not ‘stubborn’.) The Pāli for ‘willful actions’ is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>.

<p>At this point it may be good to mention that in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Cūḷavedalla Sutta</span> the bhikkhuni Dhammadinnā also speaks of three types of activities (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāras</span>).<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182" role="doc-noteref"><sup>182</sup></a> She limits physical activities to the breathing, verbal activities to mental processes that lead to speech, and mental activities to perceptions and sensations. The surrounding discussion is about the order in which these things cease when someone attains the deepest state of meditation, the cessation of perception. This is a different context from Dependent Arising. To illustrate, breathing is not based on ignorance, does not lead to the arising of consciousness, and is neither wholesome nor unwholesome. So Dhammadinnā’s definitions do not apply to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span> in Dependent Arising.<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183" role="doc-noteref"><sup>183</sup></a> She is using the three types of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span> in a different, more creative way.</p>

<p>The physical, verbal, and mental actions we are dealing with here are the ten kinds of wholesome and unwholesome deeds. To focus on the wholesome side:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

(8–10) You don’t long, are kind, and have right view.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186" role="doc-noteref"><sup>186</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Qualities 1–3 are the physical deeds; 4–7 the verbal ones; and 8–10 the mental ones. These wholesome deeds are phrased primarily in terms of abstinence here, but longer expositions also tell us that not killing includes developing compassion, not stealing includes being generous, not speaking divisively means to converse in ways that unite people, and so forth. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sāleyyaka Sutta</span> is a good example of this. It also clarifies the above groupings, saying: “Physical conduct that’s principled and moral is threefold. Verbal conduct that’s principled and moral is fourfold. Mental conduct that’s principled and moral is threefold.”<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187" role="doc-noteref"><sup>187</sup></a> The Buddha then divides these three groups of conduct into the same ten listed above.</p>

<p>Throughout the discourses <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kamma</span> (deeds) focuses on ethical conduct of this sort. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Saṅkhāra</span> (willful actions) often has a somewhat more technical slant, being more closely connected to the rebirth process itself. For example, there are so-called undisturbable (or ‘imperturbable’) <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāras</span> that lead to the rebirth in mental realms of pure and stable equanimity (hence the name ‘undisturbable’).<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188" role="doc-noteref"><sup>188</sup></a> There is also a discourse on determining one’s particular rebirth using will (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>), the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Saṅkhāra-upapatti Sutta</span>.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189" role="doc-noteref"><sup>189</sup></a> The term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kamma</span> is never used in such nuanced ways.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Showing another link between willful actions and deeds in context of rebirth, the following verse talks about ‘meritorious deeds’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puñña-kamma</span>), which means the same as wholesome deeds.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192" role="doc-noteref"><sup>192</sup></a></p>

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Karma-and-ignorance'>Karma and ignorance</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Willful actions are said to be done out of ignorance, and in the following verses Raṭṭhapāla says deeds are done out of delusion. As observed earlier, delusion is a close synonym for ignorance, so these verses again show that deeds and willful actions are synonyms too.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The dependency of deeds on ignorance is also mentioned in an interesting exchange between Mahāmoggallāna, the Buddha, and a Jain named Vappa. Like other Jains, Vappa had a different idea of karma than the Buddha.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197" role="doc-noteref"><sup>197</sup></a> The Jains thought <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">all</span> actions bind one to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, regardless of intention. The only way to not create any karma therefore was being totally inactive, especially physically. Even eating was considered karma, so this inactivity went on until the Jain saint starved himself to death. But what mattered to the Buddha are the intentions behind the deeds. And because wrong intentions exist only in the deluded mind, to make karma stop, ignorance needs to be removed.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Like other Jains, Vappa also believed karma to attract physical particles that flow into and stick to the soul. These particles (also called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āsavas</span>, ‘defilements’)<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198" role="doc-noteref"><sup>198</sup></a> weigh the soul down, binding it to earth. They can only be worn away by long periods of abstinence from any actions. Even if your behavior is completely pure in this life, rebirth will still happen if these karmic particles are not yet completely worn away. The Buddha’s response to this belief is predictable: the defilements are completely removed as soon as ignorance disappears. Then all results of previous karma end at death, after which there will be no more rebirth. The Buddha phrased his response to Vappa as a question, which I will clarify afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>[Mahāmoggallāna:] “Vappa, suppose someone is physically, verbally, and mentally restrained because their ignorance has faded away and knowledge has arisen. Do you see any reason why that person would after this life be affected by painful sensations produced by defilements?”<a href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199" role="doc-noteref"><sup>199</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“I do, sir. The results of bad deeds done in the past may not have ripened yet. Because of that, after this life that person would still be affected by painful sensations produced by defilements.” […]</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>[The Buddha:] “What do you think, Vappa? Suppose for someone the troubling and feverish defilements that arise from ignorance no longer exist, because their ignorance has faded away and knowledge has arisen. They don’t do any new deeds, and [the results of] old deeds come to an end after being repeatedly impinged by them.

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“No, sir.”<a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref200" role="doc-noteref"><sup>200</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The exchange contains a lot of Jain terminology used in a different sense by the Buddha, which makes it impossible to translate accurately.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201" role="doc-noteref"><sup>201</sup></a> So if the passage sounds a bit odd, that is why. I hope the general idea is clear regardless. According to the Buddha, if you are enlightened, you still feel the results of past karma, because it created this life, but ignorance is gone, so you don’t do any new karma, and therefore you will not be reborn. The remainder of the discourse illustrates this further. The Buddha says liberated mendicants still experience sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental phenomena—that is, they still have the six senses as a result of past deeds—but when they die, all that is experienced, not being desired, will “cool off”.</p>

<p>Knowing that deeds (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kamma</span>) are based on intentions and that they lead to the six senses through rebirth, we can also make sense of statements such as this:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what is [the result of] old deeds? The sense of sight is [a result of] old deeds, and should be seen as created by will and intention, as something to be experienced. The sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of taste, the sense of touch, and the mind are [the results of] old deeds, and should be seen as created by will and intention, as something to be experienced.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202" role="doc-noteref"><sup>202</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>A similar statement occurs in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>This body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kāya</span>) does not belong to you nor to anyone else. It is [a result of] old deeds, and should be seen as created by will and intention, as something to be experienced.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Concerning that, as a noble disciple you closely and properly focus on the dependent arising of things, reflecting: ‘There will be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">this</span>, only if there is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">that</span>. <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">This</span> arises, because <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">that</span> arises. If there isn’t <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">that</span>, there won’t be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">this</span>. If <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">that</span> ceases, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">this</span> will cease. That is to say:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Dependent on ignorance, there are willful actions. Dependent on willful actions, consciousness. Dependent on consciousness, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. … That is how this whole mass of suffering originates.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>But if ignorance completely fades away and ceases, willful actions will cease. If willful actions cease, consciousness will cease. If consciousness ceases, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body will cease. … That is how this whole mass of suffering ceases.’<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203" role="doc-noteref"><sup>203</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The six senses and the body are said to be experienced, which means they must be experienced until one passes away, even for the enlightened. They should be seen as created, which refers to their creation at the start of life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The word for ‘created’ here is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhisaṅkhata</span>, a verb connected to the noun <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>. So when the Buddha says the six senses and body should be seen as created, this also means they are the result of willful actions. Hence I used the compound expression ‘created by will’ for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhisaṅkhata</span>, following Venerable Sujato’s example.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204" role="doc-noteref"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Translating <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span> is complicated in part because the word is not only used for the act of creating; it is also employed for the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">outcome</span> of the creative act. This is similar to the English word ‘creation’, which can indicate both the active act and the passive outcome of it, as in “the creation of a creation”. The passive meaning applies to phrases such as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā</span>, ‘all that is created [through rebirth] is suffering’,<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205" role="doc-noteref"><sup>205</sup></a> but it does not apply to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span> as a factor in Dependent Arising, which are the active physical, verbal, and mental actions that create rebirth.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206" role="doc-noteref"><sup>206</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The next passage speaks on these two sides of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span> too. It is impossible to convey the linguistic connections in translation without losing some of the meaning, so I included the Pāli alongside.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And why do you call them willful actions (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāras</span>)?<a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207" role="doc-noteref"><sup>207</sup></a> They willfully create (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhisaṅkharonti</span>) the created (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhata</span>),<a href="#fn208" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208" role="doc-noteref"><sup>208</sup></a> that is why you call them willful actions. And what are the created things they create? Form is created; they create it. Sensation is created; they create it. Perception is created; they create it. Will is created; they create it. Consciousness is created; they create it.<a href="#fn209" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209" role="doc-noteref"><sup>209</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As already indicated by the linguistic twists, this is not a hard-and-fast definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span> but more a loose, almost playful explanation of why the word is used. The explanation of ‘form’ in the same sutta even contains an unmistakable pun.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210" role="doc-noteref"><sup>210</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The idea here is that willful actions are the creative forces in the rebirth process. Along with craving they fabricate the aspects of existence of the future life. Venerable Sumedhā therefore says in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Therīgāthā</span>: “The aspects of existence, elements, and senses are created (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhata</span>), rooted in <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">birth</span>.”<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211" role="doc-noteref"><sup>211</sup></a> This aligns with the definition of birth (§20), which includes the manifestation of the aspects of existence and the obtainment of the sense faculties. The Buddha similarly said about the five aspects of existence that they are “created, dependently arisen”.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212" role="doc-noteref"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Now we are also able to understand why in the simile of the painting willful actions are represented by a painter. A painter is a <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">creator</span>. Using the five paints, they produce the figure of a person, just like with the five aspects of existence you “produce” the next life.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another discourse linking willful actions directly to birth is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Precipice Discourse</span>. This discourse also serves as a great example of the Buddha’s skillful use of metaphors, which in this case he appears to make up on the spot:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture’s Peak. There he addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, let’s go to the Peak of Inspiration to spend the day.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Yes, sir,” the mendicants replied.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Then the Buddha and a number of mendicants went to the Peak of Inspiration. A certain mendicant saw the deep precipice off the Peak of Inspiration and said to the Buddha: “Venerable sir, that precipice is really deep and truly scary! Is there any precipice that is even deeper and scarier?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“There is such a precipice indeed, mendicant.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Which precipice is that, sir?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Some renunciants and brahmins do not understand in line with reality what suffering is, what the origin of suffering is, what the cessation of suffering is, and what the practice leading to the cessation of suffering is. They enjoy willful actions that lead to birth, to old age, to death, to sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress. Enjoying those willful actions, they will perform them. Having performed those willful actions, they will fall down the precipice of birth, the precipice of old age, the precipice of death, the precipice of sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress. They won’t get liberated from birth, old age, and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress. They won’t get liberated from suffering, I tell you.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This ignorance is followed in the discourse by willful actions, which in turn is followed by birth and so on. So the basic sequence is: ignorance of four truths › willful actions › birth › old age and death. The discourse therefore shifts from the ignorance sequence to the craving sequence, with the former half of its factors being the causes of rebirth and the latter half the outcome.

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Willful-actions-leading-to-consciousness'>Willful actions leading to consciousness</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With a basic understanding of the factor of willful actions, we can now consider how it connects to consciousness in the standard phrase, “dependent on willful actions, there is consciousness”. This will also clarify what the planting (or ‘establishing’) of consciousness refers to. To start, let’s consider the first paragraph of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">First Discourse on Intention</span>, which describes the continuation of consciousness in a next life as a result of certain intentions, plans, and tendencies:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Mendicants, what you intend, what you plan, and what you have a tendency towards, that is a foundation for the continuation of consciousness [after death]. If there is a foundation, there will be a support for the planting of consciousness.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215" role="doc-noteref"><sup>215</sup></a> If consciousness is planted, it will sprout, and then existence in a future life is produced. If existence in a future life is produced, future birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress will come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216" role="doc-noteref"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The phrase “what you intend, what you plan, and what you have a tendency towards” is a reference to willful actions, as is evident from the word ‘intend’ and from it being placed before the continuation of consciousness, just as willful actions precede consciousness in the default sequence. Functionally the three items of this phrase overlap to a large extent. They are not further detailed in the early texts, but I reflect on some of their differences as follows:</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘What you intend’ implies not only intentions around the moment of death but also intentional actions done throughout life. These can be recollected around death, causing remorse and elation, making one feel deserving of a certain rebirth. A discourse in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span> speaks of someone falling seriously ill, reflecting on their bad deeds, and deciding that after death they must go to a bad place. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on the Foolish and Wise</span> in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Majjhima Nikāya</span> mentions the same recollections, and then also says these “fools” are indeed reborn in a bad place.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217" role="doc-noteref"><sup>217</sup></a></p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘What you plan’ includes intentions to be reborn in a specific place. This is described in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on Rebirth Through Will</span> (<span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Saṅkhāra-upapatti Sutta</span>), a text which also brings out the connection between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāras</span> and rebirth.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218" role="doc-noteref"><sup>218</sup></a></p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘What you have a tendency towards’ refers to subtler underlying attachments that can trigger the will at death. It essentially represents ignorance and craving.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219" role="doc-noteref"><sup>219</sup></a> The tendency (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anusaya</span>) of desire for existence,<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220" role="doc-noteref"><sup>220</sup></a> for example, may only surface when one is faced with imminent death.</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discourse says these three are “a foundation for the continuation of consciousness” and “a support for the planting of consciousness”. The <span data-custom-style="Strong">continuation</span> of consciousness means its continuation <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">after death</span>, as others have also argued, not some sort of continuation while one is still alive.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221" role="doc-noteref"><sup>221</sup></a> This should already be evident from the subsequent phrase alone: “then existence in a future life is produced”. The general continuation of consciousness during life also does not depend on willful actions, so this can’t be what is referred to here. To illustrate, the consciousness of enlightened beings still continues as long as they live, even though they have no ignorance and resulting willful actions. The <span data-custom-style="Strong">planting</span> of consciousness is the mind moving on towards a certain place of rebirth, where it then “sprouts”, meaning the next life is started.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222" role="doc-noteref"><sup>222</sup></a> The next chapter illustrates this further with the simile of the seed of consciousness. The Chinese parallel skips this phrase and even more directly says: “When there is a foundation for the continuation of consciousness, there is future <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">birth</span> [and so on].”<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223" role="doc-noteref"><sup>223</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">First Discourse on Intention</span> is part of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>, the connected discourses on Dependent Arising, so we should compare it to the standard sequence. The discourse effectively follows another route through the factors: willful actions (2) › consciousness (3) › existence (10) › birth (11) › suffering (12). This reconfirms that the ignorance and craving sequences are parallel descriptions of the same process.</p>

<p>The sutta that follows the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">First Discourse on Intention</span>, unsurprisingly called the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Second Discourse on Intention</span>, also helps bring home all these points. It is more similar to the standard sequence of Dependent Arising, showing more clearly that ‘what you intend’ refers to the factor of willful actions. The conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, which we have seen refers to the conception and birth of a being, reoccurs here too.</p>

<p>In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">First Discourse on Intention</span>, the planting of consciousness is followed by the production of existence in a future life; in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Second</span> it is followed by the conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. So the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">production</span> of a future life must be equivalent to the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">conception</span> of the immaterial aspects and body. And indeed, the words ‘production’ and ‘conception’ are both part of the definition of birth: “The birth of any kind of being into whatever order of beings—them being born, their <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">conception</span>, their <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">production</span>, their aspects of existence manifesting, them obtaining the sense faculties.” The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Saṁyukta Āgama</span> parallel to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Second Discourse on Intention</span> even places birth (生) directly after the conception of the immaterial aspects and body.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225" role="doc-noteref"><sup>225</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All this confirms once again that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the being and that its conception means rebirth. It also shows that the planting of consciousness, which precedes this conception, is part of the rebirth process too.</p>

<p>The connections between ignorance, willful actions, and consciousness are also explained in another discourse in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>. It says consciousness will ‘travel on’ as a result of ignorant willful actions which are either meritorious, demeritorious, or undisturbable. (‘Meritorious’ and ‘demeritorious’ are synonyms for ‘wholesome’ and ‘unwholesome’, meaning good and bad.)<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226" role="doc-noteref"><sup>226</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discourse that defines karma as intention uses similar terminology in the phrase: “Influenced by ignorance you produce a corresponding incarnation according to your merit or demerit.”<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228" role="doc-noteref"><sup>228</sup></a> We discussed the term ‘produce’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhinibbati</span>) before, which can also be translated as ‘rebirth’.

The above passage on consciousness traveling on speaks on the same ideas, on rebirth happening according to one’s ignorant meritorious or demeritorious actions.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This can also be derived from the term ‘travel on’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upaga</span>) itself, which in this context refers to traveling on after death.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229" role="doc-noteref"><sup>229</sup></a> Later passages clarify this when mentioning that “when their body falls apart, fools will <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">travel on</span> to another body”, and that with the psychic power of divine sight “you see beings passing on and being reborn, understanding that they <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">travel on</span> according to their deeds”.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230" role="doc-noteref"><sup>230</sup></a> The connection between ‘deeds’ and ‘travel on’ in the latter example is the same as that between ‘willful actions’ and the ‘traveling on’ of consciousness in the above passage.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Way to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Undisturbable Discourse</span> more explicitly says that this traveling on of consciousness happens after death:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When their body falls apart, after death, it is possible that their onward-going consciousness will travel on to an undisturbable place.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The next passage also mentions consciousness in connection with ‘traveling on’. Stemming from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, the passage illustrates the function of the factor of consciousness in Dependent Arising.

<p>I do not want to get lost in the details here, but in brief, going by the examples of the various beings that are given for each abode, the first abode for consciousness is the sensual realm; the second, third and fourth are part of the realm with form; and the fifth, sixth and seventh are part of the realm without form. In other texts other subdivisions are made, so it seems unimportant what the exact distinctions between these seven abodes are. The more significant message is that all existence is within a certain abode of consciousness. Even beings in the highest realms are subject to the dependent arising of consciousness as a result of willful actions, which means they too are reborn in a certain place because of their intentions and actions.</p>

<h1 id='CHAPTER-6.-The-four-nutriments'>6. The four nutriments</h1>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This part focuses on discourses that treat consciousness as a metaphorical seed which gets planted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭhita</span>) in a next life. Some of them, particularly the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> (§76), also include the four nutriments, which we already encountered in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>. Since a basic knowledge of these four nutriments is assumed by these texts, I will share my understanding of them first.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-four-nutriments-and-rebirth'>The four nutriments and rebirth</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the canon the Buddha regularly mentions four nutriments (literally ‘foods’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āhāras</span>). These nutriments he says “maintain beings who are born and support those to be reborn”. That is to say, these nutriments perform two functions: they maintain the life of beings who are already born, and they are involved in their rebirth. The former is not the concern of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>, where the matter at hand is only how the four nutriments lead to rebirth. The same is true for the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span>, as we shall see. Both discourses explain what happens when there is desire, enjoyment, and attachment, which don’t keep beings alive who are already born (e.g., enlightened beings continue to live without them), but they do cause rebirth, and this is what these discourses are concerned with. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> we were also able to derive this from phrases like “the conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body”. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> even directly mentions rebirth (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upapatti</span>). Throughout the canon the main focus of the four nutriments also is rebirth. However, in the following I will also touch upon how they facilitate existence in the present life, how they maintain beings who are already born.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The four nutriments are edible food, sense impressions, intentions, and consciousness. The primary explanation of these nutriments in the Pāli Canon is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Child’s Flesh Discourse</span>. The discourse is named after a rather gruesome simile which instructs monks and nuns to not eat more food than necessary, just like parents stuck in the middle of the desert would not eat more of their child’s flesh than they would need to survive. This simile is not of relevance to our main discussion, because it is about how physical food keeps alive beings who are already born. The same applies to the nutriment of sense impressions, which is illustrated with a skinned cow who gets bitten by insects wherever she tries to hide. This refers to the fact that the six senses are unavoidable suffering for anybody who is born. So this simile too is not about rebirth but about what happens while being alive.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>However, the similes for the nutriments of intentions and consciousness—respectively, being dragged into a charcoal pit and being stabbed by spears—<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">do</span> illustrate rebirth. And even though the similes for edible food and sense impressions concern those already born, in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Child’s Flesh Discourse</span> the Buddha still explains, apart from the similes, how these two nutriments lead to rebirth.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">The nutriment of edible food</span> (more literally ‘food of solid food’—it’s a bit of a pun) symbolizes all sensual pleasures. This is because good food entices most of the physical senses—tasting, looking, and smelling good—but also because the desire to enjoy food is only fully abandoned when all sensual desires are abandoned. Sensual pleasures themselves do not cause rebirth: it’s the desire for them that does. When at death there is still a yearning for certain sensual pleasures, it can lead to rebirth in the sensual realm. To recall our central discourse, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>: “If there is desire, enjoyment, and craving for the nutriment of edible food [after death] a future life is produced.” Here the desire, enjoyment, and craving refer to the causes of rebirth in the sensual realm, the desires for sensual pleasures. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Child’s Flesh Discourse</span> accordingly says:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When you fully understand the nutriment of edible food, you fully understand the desire for the objects of the five senses. When you, as a noble disciple, fully understand the desire for the objects of the five senses, there is no more chain which could make you come back to this world [i.e. the human world] again.<a href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235" role="doc-noteref"><sup>235</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The absence of any chain that binds one to this world refers to the non-returners, who have abandoned all desires for the five senses. They have removed the five chains (or ‘fetters’) that tie them to rebirth in the sensual realm.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-space">
<p>0</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">The nutriment of sense impressions (or ‘contact’)</span> also implies the pleasant, painful, and neutral sensations that result from sense impressions. Just like with edible food, sense impressions and sensations themselves are not a nutriment for rebirth: it is the desire for them that is. Non-returners have abandoned desire for sensations coming from the five senses, but only fully enlightened beings have abandoned desire for all sensations, including those of the mind. As the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Child’s Flesh Discourse</span> says:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When you fully understand the nutriment of sense impression, you fully understand the three kinds of sensations. When you, as a noble disciple, fully understand the three kinds of sensations, there is nothing further for you to do.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The three kinds of sensations are the pleasant, painful, and neutral ones. Having nothing further to do refers to having finished the eightfold path, as in a common description of enlightened beings, who “understand that the holy life is finished, that the work is done”.<a href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236" role="doc-noteref"><sup>236</sup></a></p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">The nutriment of intention</span> refers to willful actions, which at death steer the mind towards certain realms of rebirth. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Child’s Flesh Discourse</span> the nutriment of intention does have a simile for rebirth, although it is not very explicit so will benefit from some explanation afterwards:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And, mendicants, how should you look at the nutriment of intention? Imagine a charcoal pit deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked. A man would come along who wanted to live and not die, who wanted pleasure and was averse to pain. But two strong men would grab him by the arms and dragged him towards that charcoal pit. The man’s volition, aim, and aspiration would be to get far away from that pit. Why? Because he would think: ‘If I fall into that charcoal pit, that will result in death or in deadly pains!’ Mendicants, that is how you should look at the nutriment of intention, I tell you.</p>
</div>

Figure 11. A charcoal pit as a simile for rebirth</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the simile we might initially assume that the nutriment of intention is represented by the man’s desire to get away from the pit, but the commentary astutely suggests it is instead represented by the two strong men, being unwholesome and wholesome (but still deluded) willful actions.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237" role="doc-noteref"><sup>237</sup></a> These willful actions lead to rebirth, as illustrated in the previous chapter. Being thrown in the pit stands for being reborn, and the “death or deadly pains” are the suffering and death that result from being reborn. The man’s desire to avoid the glowing coals stands for the desire to avoid suffering. Desire alone is not enough to overcome suffering, though: one needs to overcome the intentions, the two strong men, through wisdom.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Child’s Flesh Discourse</span> continues:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When you fully understand the nutriment of intention, you fully understand the three kinds of craving. When you, as a noble disciple, fully understand the three kinds of craving, there is nothing further for you to do.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The three kinds of craving are specified in the truth on the origin of suffering: “It is the craving that leads to a next life, which, along with enjoyment and desire, looks for happiness in various realms. That is to say: craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for annihilation.”<a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref238" role="doc-noteref"><sup>238</sup></a> Someone who fully understands these three types of craving that lead to a next life (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puna-bhava</span>) also understands how intentions (i.e. willful actions) lead to rebirth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>A comparable simile of a charcoal pit occurs in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">The Longer Discourse on the Lion’s Roar</span>, where it more clearly represents rebirth, in particular rebirth in a low realm.<a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref239" role="doc-noteref"><sup>239</sup></a> The simile is also referred to in verse by Venerable Migajāla, who connects it directly to Dependent Arising and deeds (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kamma</span>), and hence to intentions.

In the evening the king would again ask: ‘How is that man doing?’—‘Still alive, sire.’—And the king would say: ‘Go and stab him with a hundred spears again!’ And in the evening he would be stabbed with a hundred spears yet again.</p>

Figure 12. Spears as a simile for the rebirth of consciousness</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The simile of the spears does not explicitly refer to rebirth here, but elsewhere it more clearly does. In a discourse called <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">A Hundred Spears</span>, the Buddha says that if you were given the choice of becoming a stream enterer in exchange for being stabbed with three hundred spears a day for a hundred years (a hundred in the morning, afternoon, and evening each) you should take the deal. Why? “Transmigration has no discernible beginning”, the Buddha explains.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245" role="doc-noteref"><sup>245</sup></a> The many spears you would avoid by taking the deal stand for the amount of potential rebirths you, as a stream winner, would no longer take. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Therīgātha</span>, Venerable Sumedhā also refers to this simile. She says one should take the deal, because those who stay in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> get killed again and again.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246" role="doc-noteref"><sup>246</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Child’s Flesh Discourse</span> the spears likewise stand for rebirth and re-death. Each spear stands for another life, for another “planting” of consciousness, each of which unavoidably ends in death. Repeated death is even directly implied: being stabbed by just a single spear will usually end one’s life, let alone hundreds! Each stab with a spear represents one rebirth and consequent death. Consciousness itself doesn’t “die”, though, since it keeps coming back to future existences. The king stands for karma, say the commentaries, because he casts the judgment, like we judge our past actions and determine our rebirth based on that.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>After giving the simile of the spears, the Buddha connects consciousness directly to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When you fully understand the nutriment of consciousness, you fully understand the immaterial aspects and body. When you, as a noble disciple, fully understand the immaterial aspects and body, there is nothing further for you to do.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This is another indication the simile is about rebirth. The arising of consciousness along with the individual’s immaterial aspects and body occurs at birth, as discussed in <span data-custom-style="internal-reference">Chapter 3</span>, and as later chapters will clarify. Helmut Hecker understood the simile in the same way: “[Consciousness] always nourishes rebirth, descending into a womb, and building a new name and form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>). Just as the robber in the simile did not die despite three hundred strokes, so, despite all the suffering of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, consciousness does not die and does not want to. Again and again, it nourishes a mortal form (corporeality).”<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247" role="doc-noteref"><sup>247</sup></a></p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-two-functions-of-the-nutriment-of-consciousness'>The two functions of the nutriment of consciousness</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the above I mentioned that food and sense impressions themselves do not cause rebirth, that the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">desire</span> for them does so. With the nutriment of intention things are a little different, because it is primarily the intentions themselves that lead to rebirth, not the desire for them. The situation is still more complicated with the nutriment of consciousness, which is involved in rebirth in two ways: one is the desire for the continuation of consciousness after death, the other is consciousness as the so-called life force that perpetuates rebirth. On the latter Venerable Nyanaponika wrote: “Consciousness as a nutriment […] is explained primarily as rebirth consciousness.”<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248" role="doc-noteref"><sup>248</sup></a> This function of the nutriment of consciousness is also what the simile of the spears refers to, where each spear stands for a new rebirth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This function of the nutriment of consciousness is also clarified in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The nutriment of consciousness is a prerequisite for the production of existence in a future life. When the being is born, there are the six senses. Dependent on the six senses, there are sense impressions.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249" role="doc-noteref"><sup>249</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Here the nutriment of consciousness stands for the consciousness that continues after death, or “the stream of consciousness coming from the preceding existence”, as Venerable Bodhi annotated this passage.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250" role="doc-noteref"><sup>250</sup></a> This reminds us that all birth is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">re</span>birth, that it does not happen out of nowhere but as a continuation of a past being’s consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is worth pointing out that in this passage the phrase ‘the being is born’<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251" role="doc-noteref"><sup>251</sup></a> is positioned where we usually find the individual’s immaterial aspects and body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>): between consciousness and the six senses. This confirms the ideas of <span data-custom-style="internal-reference">Chapter 3</span>, where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was shown to refer to the being.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discussion in that chapter also included a passage from the Aṅguttara Nikāya where the conception of a fetus was connected directly to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> (§25). I abbreviated the passage there, not showing that consciousness is also involved. Here is a more complete quotation:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>These are these six elements: earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. […] From the six elements there is a conception of a fetus. When there is a conception, there are the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. Dependent on the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, there are the six senses. Dependent on the six senses, sense impressions. […]<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252" role="doc-noteref"><sup>252</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Usually the suttas speak of just four elements, but here space and consciousness are added. The resulting six elements are also mentioned in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Analysis of the Elements Discourse</span>, where they are said to constitute a person.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253" role="doc-noteref"><sup>253</sup></a> This fits the above passage, where the six elements are conditions for the conception of the fetus, i.e. the person. The four standard elements together with space make up the body or form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>) of the fetus. Relevant is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Longer Discourse on Advice to Rāhula</span>, which explains the four elements as various body parts and the “internal” space as the holes in the ears, the nose, the mouth, and so on.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254" role="doc-noteref"><sup>254</sup></a> While <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> is normally explained as the four elements, in these cases space is included as a fifth.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255" role="doc-noteref"><sup>255</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The element of consciousness, since it is said to be a condition for the conception of the fetus, must refer to consciousness that existed before birth, to consciousness that continued from the past life. This use of the term ‘consciousness’ as the carrier of life, if you will, will be further explained in <span data-custom-style="internal-reference">Chapter 8</span>. Because the six elements do not include any other mental aspects such as sensations or will, in this context consciousness stands more generally for person’s inner world as a whole, which I will also get back to. For now, just know that the term ‘consciousness’ is fluid.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If we compare the two previous extracts to the default sequence of Dependent Arising, the function of the factor of consciousness in the sequence is clarified. In §65 the nutriment of consciousness leads to the birth of a being; in §66 the element of consciousness leads to the conception of a fetus. Both passages then result in the six senses, followed by the rest of the standard sequence. Therefore, in the standard sequence the arising of consciousness and immaterial aspects and body refers to the same birth of a being and conception of a fetus.</p>

<p>In the standard sequence of Dependent Arising ‘consciousness’ represents one side of the nutriment of consciousness: the continuation of consciousness from life to life. But the nutriment of consciousness has two sides: it can not only represent the whole life that starts when the stream of consciousness enters a new incarnation, it can also represent the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">desire</span> for consciousness that fuels process of rebirth.

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Summary-of-the-four-nutriments'>Summary of the four nutriments</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To recall the start of this chapter, the four nutriments have two functions: they (A) ensure the existence of beings who are born and (B) aid those to be reborn. With no intention to be comprehensive, this is how the four nutriments ensure existence (A):</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The nutriment (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āhāra</span>) of edible food is physical food that beings need to consume to stay alive.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reestablishment of consciousness at birth (A4) depends on the four nutriments when they function as causes for rebirth (B1–4). To jump ahead a bit, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> therefore says: “consciousness with its [four] nutriments should be seen as the five kinds of seeds [for rebirth]”. The five seeds are the consciousness that moves from life to life (A4) plus the four nutriments as causes for rebirth (B1–4). The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> similarly mentioned: “If there is desire, enjoyment, and craving for the nutriment of edible food [or any of the other three nutriments], then consciousness will get planted and will sprout [in a next life].” The consciousness that gets planted is the continuing stream of consciousness that is supported by the desire for the four nutriments. This will all become clearer when we discuss the simile of the seed in the next chapter.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Not only are the four nutriments explained with similes (the charcoal pit, spears, etc.), the nutriments themselves are metaphorical too. How nutriment (or literally ‘food’) sustains day-to-day existence represents how craving sustains long-term existence through rebirth.

<p>As is quite well known, the word for ‘craving’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">taṇhā</span>) literally means ‘thirst’. But <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">taṇhā</span> is sometimes also compared to hunger. It is the hunger for existence that makes beings take up the five aspects of existence again at rebirth.</p>

<p>The Buddha also said:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>All beings are kept in existence by nutriment.<a href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259" role="doc-noteref"><sup>259</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Considering that beings have to eat to survive, at first this may seem an obvious statement. However, it includes <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">all</span> beings, including the heavenly ones, so it refers to something more profound than just physical food. Let me explain.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The basic idea that all beings require food is not originally the Buddha’s. The early <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span> state:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>From food are born all creatures; they live upon food, they are dissolved in food. Food is the chief of all things, the universal medicine. They who think of food as Spirit [Brahman], shall never lack. From food all beings are born, all beings increase their bulk; all beings feed upon it.<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260" role="doc-noteref"><sup>260</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The idea that all beings rely on food is one of the major themes of the entire Vedic corpus, including the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>. “Life and society are understood by the Vedic poets in terms of the basic struggle of acquiring food”, wrote Carlos Lopez.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261" role="doc-noteref"><sup>261</sup></a> This struggle was not limited to humans. The departed ancestors and gods were also believed to constantly require food, and even the creator of the universe was. Only food could ensure their immortality. This meant <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">literal</span> food, such as butter, grains, and so on, which had to be offered to heavenly beings in sacrificial fires by those on earth. We find echoes of these ideas also in the Pāli Canon. Brahmins (of the more traditional kind) are doing fire sacrifices in a number of suttas, and one particular text talks in detail about the benefit of offering food to departed spirits.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262" role="doc-noteref"><sup>262</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>K.R. Norman summarized the Buddha’s reply to these beliefs: “In Brahmanical thought we find the idea that food is required to sustain the existence of the inhabitants of other worlds or in the next life. The gods needed sacrifices as their food, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sanskrit">pitṛs</span> [ancestors] needed offerings to continue their existence […]. The Buddha, however, speaks of four sorts of food [<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āhāra</span>], which are instruments of continuity, and imply the future process of rebirth.”<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263" role="doc-noteref"><sup>263</sup></a> The importance society put on physical food may well explain why the Buddha chose to represent all sense pleasures with edible food. But he also played with these ideas in several other ways. By saying beings don’t just rely on physical food but also on “food” of sense impressions and consciousness, he questioned the validity of food offerings to the gods, who don’t actually need physical food to continue existing. More importantly, while to Brahmins food was considered a good thing—because it ensures a long or eternal life in heaven—the Buddha said the nutriments were a problem, exactly because they lead to more existence:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>Whatever suffering there may be,<br>
all originates dependent on intake of nutriments.<br>
If intake of nutriments ceases,<br>
no suffering will come to be.<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264" role="doc-noteref"><sup>264</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Buddha taught his disciples to be “hungerless” and no longer feed themselves on these nutriments. The idea is quite striking. If you stop eating, your life will soon come to an end. The Buddha is telling his disciples to no longer “eat” the four metaphorical nutriments, so they “starve” and won’t keep existing after death. In other words, if you stop craving, you will stop the intake (or uptake, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span>) of nutriments, which leads to the end of existence. This is stated in the cessation sequence as: “If craving ceases, fuel/taking up (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span>) will cease. If fuel/taking up ceases, existence will cease.” Here <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span> stands for both the nutriment (‘fuel’) and the intake of the nutriment. (To convey both ideas I use the dual translation ‘fuel/taking up’.) Statements such as this must have been especially challenging to the Brahmins, who worshipped both food and existence.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With the four nutriments, the Buddha used the life of a sentient being as a metaphor for continued existence after death, but he also frequently used the life of <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">plants</span> as a metaphor for these things. This chapter illustrates some of these metaphors, which shed a lot of light on the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> (‘consciousness is planted’).</p>

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Consciousness-as-a-seed-for-rebirth'>Consciousness as a seed for rebirth</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>A prominent simile for rebirth in the canon is one wherein consciousness acts as a seed for rebirth. Earlier passages already implied this simile in phrases such as, “if consciousness is planted, it will sprout”. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bhava Sutta</span>, the Buddha describes it explicitly:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Venerable Ānanda approached the Buddha, bowed to him, and sat down to a side. He then asked: “Venerable sir, you mentioned existence (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>), but how is there existence?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Ānanda, would existence in the sensual worlds occur if there were no deeds that ripened [or ‘resulted’] in the sensual realm?”</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The word I translate as ‘planted’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭhita</span>) is usually translated as ‘established’. This translation is not wrong per se, but it does not fit the simile very well, because in English we wouldn’t say a seed is “established” in the ground. However, in Pāli seeds are “<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭhita</span>-ed” there. It is said, for example, that a farmer first ploughs his field and then plants (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭha</span>) his seeds.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267" role="doc-noteref"><sup>267</sup></a> So the translation ‘planted’ gives a better sense of how people at the time would have understood the term in this context.<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268" role="doc-noteref"><sup>268</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Using similar reasoning, I translate <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">virūḷhi</span> as ‘sprouting’. It too is part of the simile of the seed. In one passage the word is used with reference to a dormant seed of a creeper. Venerable Bodhi translated, following Venerable Ñāṇamoli: “Being moistened by rain from a rain-bearing cloud, the seed in due course sprouted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viruheyya</span>)”.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269" role="doc-noteref"><sup>269</sup></a> Although in other contexts ‘growth’ might be a more suitable translation for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">virūḷhi</span>, considering this passage, ‘sprouting’ must be the intended meaning in the seed simile.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With that in mind, the general idea of the Buddha’s reply to Ānanda is as follows: When a being produces rebirth, the seed of their consciousness is metaphorically planted in a certain realm that aligns with their karma. Like bad fields produce bad plants and good field good plants, bad deeds lead to bad rebirths and good deeds to good ones. Wherever consciousness is reborn, there the next life with all its characteristics takes shape, which is represented by the seed sprouting and growing into a plant. In order to grow, a seed needs water too, and this water represents craving. For clarification, see the following illustrations:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The three kinds of karma leading to rebirth in the three respective realms are similar to the demeritorious, meritorious, and undisturbable willful actions mentioned in §55, which lead to consciousness traveling on to the respective places.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The sprouting of seeds is a striking representation of rebirth and would have been even more so in a society that was as agriculture-centered as the Buddha’s. It creates a very visual image of the cyclic nature of life. A plant develops a seed, which sprouts and grows into a new plant, which develops a new seed, and so forth. When the first plant dies, its offshoot will live into the future, in something like the plant’s next life. I think we would be hard-pressed to come up with a more fitting simile for rebirth.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Although it does seem to be implied by the simile, the idea of repeated plants growing from repeated seeds is not specifically mentioned in the early Pāli texts. But it is mentioned in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Questions of Milinda</span>, a late text included in the Burmese canon:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The king [Milinda] said: “Venerable Nāgasena, you speak of this ‘transmigration’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>). What is this transmigration?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Your Majesty, someone is born somewhere and dies there, and is reborn somewhere else. He is born there and dies there, and is reborn somewhere else again. That is how there is transmigration.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Can you give a simile?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“It’s like a person eats a ripe mango and plants its stone. It produces a big mango tree which grows fruits. Then the person eats a ripe mango from it and plants its stone. It too produces a big mango tree which grows fruits. In that way no end to the trees is seen. Likewise, someone is born somewhere and dies there, and is reborn somewhere else. He is born there and dies there, and is reborn somewhere else again. That is how there is transmigration.”<a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270" role="doc-noteref"><sup>270</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The eating of the mango I understand to represent death, the shedding of the body. The stone (or pit) of the mango is the remaining part of the being which moves on to the next life. However, to be clear, this remaining part is also without any real essence. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Visuddhimagga</span> uses the same simile in context of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anatta</span>, reminding us there is no self involved in the process of rebirth, just like no part of the original tree is found in its ancestors.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271" role="doc-noteref"><sup>271</sup></a></p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Verses-on-the-seed-simile'>Verses on the seed simile</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Throughout the Pāli Canon there are a number of verses that refer to the seed simile, in each case connecting it directly to rebirth. The first example is a set of verses spoken by the nun Selā:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>This puppet [i.e. being] is not made by oneself;<br>
this misery is not made by another.<br>
It has come into being dependent on conditions,<br>
and ceases by the destruction of those conditions.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>Just as a seed sprouts<br>
when sown in a field,<br>
based on two things:<br>
nutriments in the earth and moisture,</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>so the aspects of existence and the elements,<br>
and these six senses too,<br>
have come into being dependent on conditions,<br>
and cease by the destruction of those conditions.<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272" role="doc-noteref"><sup>272</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As often happens in verse, Selā points to certain similes assuming the listener knows what is being referred to. She effectively says that, just like a plant will sprout when a seed is planted in earth and given water, the being—the aspects of existence, six elements, and senses—will be reborn when it is supported by karma and craving.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>By saying that the being is not made by oneself and that it is just the aspects of existence, Selā also refers to the concept of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anatta</span>, the absence of a soul or self. The seed simile also conveys this idea, because the new plant, although it is directly linked to the parent plant through the seed, does not actually share any physical parts with it. Similarly, one life of a sentient being is linked to its next life through an ever-changing stream of consciousness. There is a clear connection between the two lives—it’s not a completely separate being after all—but nothing of essence, such as a soul, transfers from one life to the next.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The well-known <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Ratana Sutta</span> contains another verse on the seed simile. The Buddha says that the enlightened ones, with no desire for further existence, will not create a new life (“nothing new comes to be”). All existence (“the old”) comes to an end, because they have ended rebirth (“the seed”), and have no wish to be reborn (“to sprout”).</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>The old ended, and nothing new comes to be:<br>
with minds that lost the desire for future existence,<br>
having ended the seed, not wishing to sprout,<br>
bright people get extinguished just like this lamp.<a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273" role="doc-noteref"><sup>273</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>A less famous set of verses in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Suttanipāta</span> describes the same ideas. The moisture still represents craving here, but the ground now represents the various realms of rebirth instead of karma:<a href="#fn274" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274" role="doc-noteref"><sup>274</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All these verses did not mention consciousness to be the seed. We have a more basic metaphor, where the seed represents the possibility for rebirth more generally.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-Seeds-Discourse'>The Seeds Discourse</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another text which equates consciousness to a seed is the Seeds Discourse. It has the same basic simile as the exchange with Ānanda on how existence comes to be (§71) but it differs in some details:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Consciousness is still said to be the seed, but now it is joined by the four nutriments.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The seed is still said to be watered, now not by craving but by desire and enjoyment, which are just different manifestations of craving.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The seed is still said to be planted, now not in the field of karma but in the earth of the four aspects of existence other than consciousness. These ideas are closely linked, because the quality of one’s future aspects of existence is directly connected to the quality of one’s karma, like the quality of the earth is directly connected to the quality of the field.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discourse also specifically mentions the situation where the seed is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">not</span> planted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span>). Here it makes a new point, namely that consciousness can’t continue to exist without the other aspects of existence. To avoid any possible confusion, since consciousness is mentioned alongside the other four aspects of existence, it should be clear that ‘consciousness’ throughout the discourse simply refers to the fifth aspect of existence, whether it is planted or not planted, not to some “unestablished” consciousness outside of these five.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With all that in mind, here is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Mendicants, there are five kinds of seeds. What five? Seeds of plants grown from roots, from stems, from joints, from cuttings, and from seeds. If these seeds are fertile and well-preserved—not broken, spoiled, or damaged by the wind or sun—but they lack earth and water, would they develop, sprout, and mature?”</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Mendicants, the four supports for consciousness [i.e. the four other aspects of existence] should be seen as the earth. Enjoyment and desire should be seen as the water. Consciousness with its nutriments should be seen as the five kinds of seeds.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Consciousness would continue to exist [after death] if it is attracted to form. Founded on form, planted in form, and sprinkled with enjoyment, it would develop, sprout, and mature.

Consciousness would continue to exist if it is attracted to perception. Founded on perception, planted in perception, and sprinkled with enjoyment, it would develop, sprout, and mature. Consciousness would continue to exist if it is attracted to will. Founded on will, planted in will, and sprinkled with enjoyment, it would develop, sprout, and mature.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Some might say they will describe the departing or arriving of consciousness, its passing on or rebirth—its development, sprouting, or maturation—apart from form, sensation, perception, and will.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Because this discourse is very helpful to understand what the planting and not planting of consciousness imply, allow me to explain it in detail. The following illustration visualizes the main ideas:</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discourse is centered around rebirth, which is particularly evident when it mentions “the departing or arriving of consciousness, its passing on or rebirth”. The words ‘passing on’ (<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">cuti</span>) and ‘rebirth’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upapatti</span>) are sometimes translated along the lines of ‘passing away’ and ‘reappearing’, which may slightly obscure what they are about, but that they refer to rebirth is unambiguous in many places, one of which is the standard description of the psychic powers of past life recollection and the divine eye (or ‘divine sight’):</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>You direct [your mind] to recollecting past lives. You recall many kinds of past lives: one birth; two, three, four, five births; ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty births; a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births; […]. You remember you name in a certain place, your clan, appearance, and food, the pleasure and pain you experienced, and how you died. You remember <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">passing on</span> from there, and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">being reborn</span> somewhere else. You remember your name there too, your clan, appearance, and food, the pleasure and pain you experienced, and how you died. You remember passing on from there, and being reborn here.

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>You direct [your mind] to knowing the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">passing on</span> and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">rebirth</span> of beings. With pure and superhuman divine sight you see beings passing on and being reborn, having high or low births, in good or bad places, becoming beautiful or ugly. You understand that beings travel on according to their deeds. Those with bad physical, verbal, and mental conduct, who criticize the noble ones, have wrong view, and do deeds based on wrong view, get reborn in the lower plane, in a bad destination, a netherworld, a hell. But those with good physical, verbal, and mental conduct, who do not criticize the noble ones, have right view, and do deeds based on right view, get reborn in a good destination, in a heaven. That is how you see beings passing on and being reborn, understanding that they travel on according to their deeds.<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281" role="doc-noteref"><sup>281</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In another passage the Buddha talks about the possibility of going to heaven, asking his non-enlightened disciples to reflect: “I too have the kind of faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and understanding that those gods had, that resulted in their <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">passing on</span> from here and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">being reborn</span> there.”<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282" role="doc-noteref"><sup>282</sup></a> In the definition of death at §20 he mentioned, “the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">passing on</span> of any kind of being from any order of beings—their passing away, deceasing, dying […]” Still elsewhere he said: “A being laid down their body and is not yet <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">reborn</span> in another body.”<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283" role="doc-noteref"><sup>283</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The terms ‘departing’ (<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">gati</span>) and ‘arriving’ (<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">āgati</span>)—also translated as ‘going’ and ‘coming’—are euphemisms for passing on and rebirth.<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284" role="doc-noteref"><sup>284</sup></a> When Anuruddha spoke of his divine sight, he said: “I see the passing on and rebirth of beings, their <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">departing</span> and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">arriving</span>, going from one state of existence to another.” In The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Great Lion’s Roar Discourse</span> the Buddha used the same ability to see renunciants (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samaṇas</span>) traveling to heavens and hells and said: “I know the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">departure</span> and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">arrival</span>, the passing on and rebirth of those renunciants.” More down to earth, Paṭācārā talked about the death of her son, saying: “He passed away having a human body and will go on transmigrating. As he <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">arrived</span>, so he <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">departed</span>: why grieve over that?”<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285" role="doc-noteref"><sup>285</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There are many similar instances of these words in the Canon, so there should be no question what the Seeds Discourse is about: the “departing or arriving of consciousness, its passing on or rebirth—its development, sprouting, or maturation” means rebirth.<a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286" role="doc-noteref"><sup>286</sup></a> The last three terms might seem strange ways to refer to rebirth, but like ‘planting’ they are part of the simile in which consciousness is the seed for rebirth. Literal seeds that are buried in the earth and then given water are also said to develop, sprout, and mature.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287" role="doc-noteref"><sup>287</sup></a> The three individual terms might refer to different stages of the rebirth process, like entering a womb, getting born, and growing up, but this is not clarified anywhere. They could also be synonyms.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In any event, it indicates that an earlier statement in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> also refers to rebirth: “Consciousness would continue to exist if it is attracted to form. Founded on form, planted in form, and sprinkled with enjoyment, it would develop, sprout, and mature [i.e. be reborn].” ‘Sprinkled with enjoyment’ is also part of the simile, because enjoyment is compared to water. The phrase ‘consciousness would continue to exist if it is attracted to form’ refers to the continuation of consciousness after death, because, as I argued earlier, the continuation of consciousness while one is alive does not depend on being attracted to something. The phrase is not grammatically intricate but has been translated rather cryptically by some translators, who either through over-literalism or not understanding the context speak of the “standing” of consciousness.<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288" role="doc-noteref"><sup>288</sup></a> But that ‘consciousness would continue to exist’ implies rebirth is also reflected in the following:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Mendicants, it would be better for your eyes to be lacerated by a searing, burning, glowing, red-hot iron nail, than for you to, because of its features, get caught up in the aspects of a sight you might see. I say this because I have seen the following problem. <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Consciousness would continue to exist</span> if it stays bound to the gratification in those aspects or features. And if you die at that time [when you’re caught up in sights], it is possible that it goes to one of two destinations: hell or the animal realm.<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289" role="doc-noteref"><sup>289</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the Seeds Discourse the four nutriments together with consciousness are compared to five seeds. Since one of the four nutriments is consciousness itself, it seems like it is included twice in the five seeds. However, this double inclusion represents the two different functions of the nutriment of consciousness: one is the desire for consciousness, the other is the stream of consciousness that continues from life to life. So the five seeds are:</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Desire for the five senses (the nutriment of edible food)</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Desire for sensations (the nutriment of sense impressions)</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Willful actions that lead to rebirth (the nutriment of intentions)</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Desire for existence (the nutriment of consciousness in one sense)</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The stream of consciousness (the nutriment of consciousness in the second sense)</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Although there are five metaphorical seeds, their result is of course only one rebirth, not five. In a sense, the first four seeds just assist the fifth. This is why in <span data-custom-style="internal-reference">figure 18</span> I drew one big seed surrounded by four smaller ones.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To return to my main point, there are many indications the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> is about rebirth: the similarity with the exchange with Ānanda on the seeds for existence (§71); the words ‘departing’, ‘arriving’, ‘passing on’, and ‘rebirth’; the phrase ‘consciousness would continue to exist’; and the four nutriments that assist beings to be reborn. I clarified this in detail, because this central point is sometimes overlooked, and as a result the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> is also misunderstood. What this refers to, is explained next.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Not-planting-the-seed'>Not planting the seed</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> compares the four aspects of existence (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>) to the earth. This tells us that, just like a seed cannot grow if it is not planted in the ground, consciousness cannot continue to exist without any other aspect of existence. The discourse therefore also calls these four aspects of existence ‘the four supports for consciousness’. Consciousness is especially closely connected to sensation and perception. The three cannot be separated from one another (see §99), so the desire for any type of sensation or perception is always accompanied by a desire for consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Since consciousness is intrinsically connected to the other four aspects of existence, if desire for them is abandoned, consciousness gets abandoned too. The figurative seed of rebirth then cannot sprout again. As the discourse says: “If you have abandoned desire for the elements of form, sensation, perception, and will, there will be no support for the planting of consciousness, because when desire is abandoned, its foundation is destroyed. Not planted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span>), consciousness will not sprout [i.e. be reborn].” See also the following illustration:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-figure">

Figure 19. Not planting consciousness as a simile for the end of rebirth</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>So the suggestion that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> is an unestablished consciousness separate from and uninfluenced by the aspects of existence, does not seem valid. The point is the exact opposite. The Buddha taught that consciousness cannot exist without the other aspects of existence, that it always depends on something, always is “established” somewhere.</p>

<p>There are still more discourses that connect seeds to rebirth, like some that call noble ones who will be reborn only once more ‘one-seeders’.<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290" role="doc-noteref"><sup>290</sup></a> But I want to introduce instead three discourses that use other botanical similes for rebirth, for they are more helpful in explaining the principles of Dependent Arising.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The first discourse depicts the continuation of existence as a sapling that is being kept alive. It begins with ‘focusing on the gratification of things that can chain’ (or ‘that can fetter’), which means perceiving things as pleasant which are actually suffering: a major aspect of ignorance. This ignorance gives rise to craving, after which the usual factors of the craving sequence follow.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Mendicants, for those who live focusing on the gratification of things that can chain them, craving increases. Dependent on craving, there is fuel [for rebirth]. Dependent on fuel, existence. Dependent on existence, birth. And dependent on birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Imagine a sapling. From time to time a man would clear the area around it and give it fresh soil and water. With that nutriment, with that fuel, that sapling would develop, sprout, and mature. Likewise, for those who live focusing on the gratification of things that can chain them, craving increases. Dependent on craving, there is fuel. Dependent on fuel, existence. Dependent on existence, birth. And dependent on birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>For those who live focusing on the problems with things that can chain them, craving ceases. If craving ceases, fuel will cease. If fuel ceases, existence will cease. If existence ceases, birth will cease. And if birth ceases, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress, will cease. That is how this whole mass of suffering ceases.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Imagine a sapling. A man would come along carrying a spade and basket. He would cut off the sapling at its roots and then dig up and pull out the roots, even the small roots and the root fibers. He would cut the entire stalk into pieces, split the pieces, and break them into splinters. He would dry those in the sun and wind and then burn them in a fire, turning them into ashes. He would let the ashes get blown away by a strong wind or get carried away by a swift river. In that way the sapling would be cut off at its roots, made like a palm stump, put to an end, so that it would not rearise in the future. Likewise, for those who live focusing on the problems with things that can chain them, craving ceases. If craving ceases, fuel will cease. If fuel ceases, existence will cease. If existence ceases, birth will cease. And if birth ceases, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress, will cease. That is how this whole mass of suffering ceases.<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291" role="doc-noteref"><sup>291</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The life of the plant is a metaphor for the existence of the being. A plant can only stay alive if it is given water. Likewise, existence can only continue in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> as long as there is craving. But when the problems with existence are understood, craving will cease, and there will be no more fuel for the continuance of existence after death.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The word for ‘fuel’ is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span>, which earlier I translated with the two terms ‘fuel/taking up’. Often both meanings are implied, but in this discourse ‘fuel’ is the primary meaning, since it reoccurs in the metaphor in which the water and soil are called fuel (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span>) for the plant. This stands for craving, which acts as the fuel for rebirth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The metaphor of fuel is more famously applied to fires, but the Buddha also used it with reference to plants, as we see here. This is one reason I translate the verbal meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span> as ‘taking up’ instead of the more common ‘clinging’ or ‘grasping’, which I think are slightly inaccurate.<a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292" role="doc-noteref"><sup>292</sup></a> Plants are also said to ‘take up’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādiyati</span>) nutrients from the soil.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293" role="doc-noteref"><sup>293</sup></a> They don’t ‘cling to’ or ‘grasp’ such nutriments. So when the Buddha instructs his followers to stop <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span>, one implication is that we should no longer <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">take up</span> the five aspects of existence through craving, especially not at the end of life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The next text illustrates this concept more explicitly. It describes a tree that draws up (or takes up) sap through its roots. The life of the tree stands for the continuation of existence, just like the life of the sapling in the previous discourse.</p>

<p>Here the focusing on gratification is not followed by the craving sequence as in §79, but by the conception of the immaterial aspects and body, which is followed by the rest of the standard sequence. The conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body always happens in tandem with the conception of consciousness, because these two factors together constitute the being. This will be further clarified in §84, which describes the conception of consciousness alongside the immaterial aspects and body in a mother’s womb. The following sutta, which in all other aspects is identical to the last, places the conception of consciousness before the individual’s immaterial aspects and body:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This discourse contains the saying, “there will be no conception of consciousness. If consciousness ceases”, hence ‘no conception of consciousness’ implies the cessation of consciousness. The cessation of consciousness happens when an enlightened being passes away. Therefore, the opposite statement, ‘there will be a conception of consciousness’, must refer to the time of rebirth. Along similar lines of reasoning, the conception of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in the previous discourse also refers to rebirth, which is relevant to our primary text, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>, because it contains the same phrase.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If we compare the three suttas in this section, we can also confirm that the two parallel sequences in the full twelve-factored sequence describe rebirth, because we see that the conception of consciousness and the conception of the immaterial aspects and body are alternative ways to describe the creation of another existence and birth. Put schematically:</p>

<p>To repeat the main points of this chapter, the similes of the seeds and plants visualize the continuation of existence through rebirth. The planting (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭhita</span>) of the seed of consciousness stands for taking rebirth in a certain place, and it not being planted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span>) means not being reborn. Similarly, the conception of consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the start of a life, and when they are not conceived again, it means they will both cease.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> explained that it is impossible for consciousness to be reborn without other aspects of existence, which are metaphorically called the earth in which the seed of consciousness is planted. The next passage phrases the same idea differently, with these four aspects of existence being ‘shelters’ for consciousness:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The element of form is a shelter for consciousness. If, by desiring it, your consciousness is bound to the element of form, you are called ‘a migrant going from shelter to shelter’. The elements of sensation … perception … will is a shelter for consciousness. If, by desiring it, your consciousness is bound to the element of will, you are called ‘a migrant going from shelter to shelter’.<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297" role="doc-noteref"><sup>297</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Truth­finder (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tathāgata</span>) is then said to be without a shelter. Without any desire for the aspects of existence they “cut them at the roots, made them like a palm stump, so that they will not rearise in the future”, which means the aspect of existence won’t reoccur in a next life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Wijesekara already concluded that in this passage consciousness is “the surviving factor of an individual [which produces] repeated births resulting in what is generally known as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.”<a href="#fn298" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298" role="doc-noteref"><sup>298</sup></a> But he does not note that the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sārin</span> (migrant) comes from the same root as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> (transmigration), and therefore also implies rebirth. In the Seeds Discourse, consciousness was said to continue in a next life if it is attracted to the other four aspects of existence; here it is said to migrate if it is bound to them by desire. It is the same principle in different words.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Both the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> and this passage also uniquely call the aspects of existence ‘elements’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātus</span>), which may also show a close connection between the two texts. They both tell us that there is no possibility of consciousness continuing in isolation, without any other aspects accompanying it. Whenever there is awareness, it is always aware of something and always depends on the sense faculties. There are no realms or places where this does not apply. Wherever consciousness is reborn, it is always along with other aspects of existence.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In some discourses on Dependent Arising, consciousness is said to be dependent not on the other four aspects of existence but on the immaterial aspects and body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>), which then effectively stand for these aspects of existence. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">City Discourse</span> is one example:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was heading for awakening but not yet fully awake—I thought: ‘Oh no! People have really gotten into trouble. They are born, age, die, pass on, and are reborn again. Yet they don’t see any escape from this suffering, this old age and death and so on. When will an escape from all this finally be found?’</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>[As §11.]</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Then I thought: ‘There will be the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, only if there is what?

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Then I thought: ‘Consciousness can’t go beyond the immaterial aspects and body. That is what it always turns back to. This is the extent to which beings can get born, age, die, pass on, and get reborn again—namely, consciousness which depends on the immaterial aspects and body along with the immaterial aspects and body which depend on consciousness.’<a href="#fn299" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref299" role="doc-noteref"><sup>299</sup></a></p>

This is a clear indication that the dependency between consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> concerns the process of rebirth and the life that results from it, not momentary states of mind or processes of recognition, as some have suggested.<a href="#fn301" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref301" role="doc-noteref"><sup>301</sup></a></p>

<p>The Sarvāstivāda and Dharmaguptaka parallels to this passage in the Āgamas differ in some ways, but convey the same basic ideas.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Because there can be no sentient existence without consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, they are the extent to which there is birth and death, “the extent to which the cycle of rebirth continues so life here (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">itthatta</span>) manifests”. This statement links back to an earlier sentence in the passage: “Would the individual’s immaterial aspects and body be produced further (or ‘be reborn’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhinibbatti</span>) so as to start the life here (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">itthatta</span>)?” The term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">itthatta</span> is difficult to translate consistently, but it means a life in a certain place, not a state of “thisness” or “a concept of a something”.<a href="#fn304" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref304" role="doc-noteref"><sup>304</sup></a> In this sutta the term specifically refers to a human life, but it can also refer to other forms of existence.<a href="#fn305" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref305" role="doc-noteref"><sup>305</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the statements on the extent of language and understanding are present in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, they do not occur in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">City Discourse</span>, which only mentions that consciousness with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is the extent to which there is rebirth and death. A virtually identical passage in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahāpadāna Sutta</span> does the same.<a href="#fn307" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref307" role="doc-noteref"><sup>307</sup></a> The Dharmaguptaka parallel to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> also lacks the statements on language and understanding.<a href="#fn308" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref308" role="doc-noteref"><sup>308</sup></a> On these and other bases Vetter concluded these statements to be late additions to the Pāli version.<a href="#fn309" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref309" role="doc-noteref"><sup>309</sup></a> They are possibly brought in from a later passage in the discourse, where they fit the context much better, since it speaks of the limitations of using the word ‘truth­finder’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tathāgata</span>) to describe what happens to an enlightened being after death.<a href="#fn310" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref310" role="doc-noteref"><sup>310</sup></a> (<span data-custom-style="internal-reference">Chapter 12</span> will expand on this.)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Putting their questionable authenticity aside, the statements on the limited extent of language and understanding can be understood once we recognize that without consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> there simply is no existence at all. Outside of them there is only the cessation of existence, also known as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span> (full extinguishment). With this in mind, I think there are two possible interpretations of statement <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">a</span>, on there being no way for language without consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The first option takes what we could call a third-person perspective on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>, looking at it from the point of view of a person who has <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">not</span> attained it. It argues that after the full extinguishment of someone else (or of oneself projected into the future) there is no longer anything to be named or described.<a href="#fn311" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref311" role="doc-noteref"><sup>311</sup></a> Even negations can be misconstrued. As Venerable Ajahn Brahm wrote, “it is a problem with language that when we describe what a thing is not, what qualities are absent, then the negation or the absence can easily be misunderstood as a thing in itself”.<a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref312" role="doc-noteref"><sup>312</sup></a> This is certainly true in general. However, throughout the discourses the Buddha does describe <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span> in various ways—the cessation of consciousness along with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> being in fact one of these ways—so clearly it is not fully indescribable.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The second option, the one I prefer, takes more of a first-person perspective. It argues that without consciousness and the immaterial aspects and body there is no way for language, simply because there is no longer anybody or anything left to <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">use</span> language. In other words, after the cessation of consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> there is no descriptive activity anymore. Bhikkhu Bodhi seems to understand the statement in the same way: “It is in the mental body that designations, linguistic expressions, and descriptions take shape.”<a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313" role="doc-noteref"><sup>313</sup></a> Without such a mental body (or ‘immaterial aspects’) there is no longer a way to use language.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The veracity of this interpretation is backed up by statement <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">b</span>, on there being no understanding (or ‘wisdom’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paññā</span>) outside of consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. We can’t take the third-person perspective here. That is to say, this can't mean that understanding only reaches as far as consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> go, because what lies beyond them—i.e. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>—can also be understood. In this case it must mean that after the cessation of consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> there is no understanding anymore, simply because there is nothing left to <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">have</span> the understanding. Put differently, when the enlightened being passes away, their mental faculty to understand things passes away as well. Understanding only exists as long as consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> exist. This is supported by §92, where it is said that understanding ceases when consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> cease. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Cūḷaniddesa</span> comments on this: “When the enlightened one is fully extinguished by the kind of extinguishment which leaves no remnant (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anupādisesa nibbānadhātu</span>), with the cessation of their final consciousness, understanding and the immaterial aspects and body cease too.”<a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314" role="doc-noteref"><sup>314</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This interpretation might not have the intricate implications others have derived from these terse and, frankly, rather unexplanatory statements on the extent of language and understanding.<a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315" role="doc-noteref"><sup>315</sup></a> But a fundamental principle in textual analysis is to interpret the doubtful and rare in light of the clear and common. This interpretation does so, as it aligns with the more transparent and frequent statement that consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> are the extent to which beings can exist, and with the passage on the womb which contains these statements, where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the being, not to concepts or cognitive processes. The idea is simple: life, including language and understanding, only exists as long as there is consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. When consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> cease, these things can no longer be.<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316" role="doc-noteref"><sup>316</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With those two statements addressed, hopefully to some satisfaction, we can consider the actual dependencies between consciousness and individual’s immaterial aspects and body.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-dependency-of-consciousness-on-nāmarūpa'>The dependency of consciousness on nāmarūpa</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>We start with <span data-custom-style="Strong">dependency 2</span>, that of consciousness on the immaterial aspects and body. This dependency is not part of the default chain of twelve factors, where consciousness depends on willful actions instead, but it is mentioned in a handful of suttas, including the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna</span>.<a href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317" role="doc-noteref"><sup>317</sup></a> When the Buddha explains this dependency to Ānanda in the passage on the womb, he says there would be no future birth if consciousness “does not find a support of any immaterial aspects and body to be planted in”.<a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318" role="doc-noteref"><sup>318</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> conveys the same principle, saying consciousness can’t continue to exist if it is not planted in the other aspects of existence. The similarity between these two statements confirms two earlier observations: the planting of consciousness indeed refers to rebirth, and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> can indeed stand for the other four aspects of existence.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The same concepts were also expressed in the passage on consciousness migrating from shelter to shelter. All these texts tell us that consciousness depends on other things. There is no place where consciousness exists in isolation. Wherever beings can be reborn, there are always other aspects of existence as well. In the words of Hamilton, “the mutual dependence of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> […] is established in order to prevent independent existence being ascribed to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>.”<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319" role="doc-noteref"><sup>319</sup></a> This is why consciousness together with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is the extent to which there is existence, “the extent to which the cycle of rebirth continues so life here manifests”.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> explains the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">origination</span> of consciousness along with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, which refers specifically to birth. This should be kept in mind when contemplating the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">origination</span> sequence of Dependent Arising. However, the mutual dependency between consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> continues after birth as well. Venerable Bodhi stated: “Consciousness requires mentality-materiality [<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>] not only at conception, but all throughout life. It depends on a vital functioning body with its brain, nervous system, and sense faculties. It also depends on the mental body [i.e. immaterial aspects], as there can be no cognition of an object without the more specialized functions performed by contact, sensation, perception, volition, attention, and the rest.”<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320" role="doc-noteref"><sup>320</sup></a> Langer likewise concluded: “An obvious explanation for the dependence of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is that—at least in the sensual realm—the process of consciousness takes place with the sense organs as its basis […] and therefore a functioning <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> […] requires a body.”<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321" role="doc-noteref"><sup>321</sup></a> In simple terms, for consciousness to be reborn and continue to function, there needs to be other stuff, there need to be ‘immaterial aspects and body’.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This might all sound very abstract, but some discourses ask the meditator to reflect on this as follows:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When your mind has been unified in this way—cleansed and purified, free from blemishes and impurities—it becomes wieldy and workable, still and undisturbable. Then you direct it to knowledge and insight, reflecting: ‘This is my body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kāya</span>) which is made of form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>), made up of the four elements, created by my mother and father, built from rice and porridge, of a temporary nature, of the nature to deteriorate and degenerate, to decay and fall apart. And this is my consciousness which is bound and tied to it.’</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Imagine a beryl gem that has all good qualities, being naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded. It is strung with a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread. Someone with good eyesight would take it in their hand and examine it, thinking: ‘This beryl gem has all good qualities, being naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded. And it is strung with a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.’</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Likewise, when your mind has been unified in this way […] you direct it to knowledge and insight, reflecting: ‘This is my body […] And this is my consciousness which is bound and tied to it.’<a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322" role="doc-noteref"><sup>322</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>When a similar simile occurs elsewhere, it is about the rebirth of the Bodhisattva or, when used by non-Buddhist, about a self that survives death.<a href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323" role="doc-noteref"><sup>323</sup></a> Survival after death is also implied in the above. The pure gem represents consciousness, which in this case stands for the mind or spirit more generally. (More on this shortly.) The different color threads stand for the various bodies consciousness can be reborn into.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-figure">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reflection is done after the meditator emerges from the deep meditative states called jhānas. In the jhānas you have looked at the mind directly, vividly seeing it function separately from the five bodily senses. It is like going to different universe, the universe of the mind. If you reflect on this experience even briefly, it will be difficult if not impossible for you to still hold a materialistic view of life. You realize the mind is non-material and can survive after death. However, in this life it is bound to this particular body, like the gem is tied to a particular color string.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This realization, even though it can be life changing, in the discourses is only the first and lowest of a series, so it is still far from a full insight into the conditioned existence of consciousness. But it is a significant way in which the dependency of consciousness on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> has pragmatic relevance even before deeper insight develops. It is a start to directly seeing the mechanisms of rebirth and therefore Dependent Arising.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>So, consciousness depends on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> throughout life. However, in the origination sequence, which describes its <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">arising</span>, the terms refer specifically to rebirth, which is why the Buddha explains the dependency by describing the conception of a fetus in a womb. The cessation sequence accordingly refers to the end of life:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>If the individual’s immaterial aspects and body cease, consciousness will cease. If consciousness ceases, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body will cease. If the individual’s immaterial aspects and body cease, the six senses will cease. [And so on.] That is how this whole mass of suffering ceases.<a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324" role="doc-noteref"><sup>324</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>When <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> ceases, consciousness ceases too, and so do the six senses, sense impressions, and sensations. A later passage on the difference between the foolish and the wise (§108) shows that enlightened beings still have these things, so this cessation only happens when they pass away.</p>

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Brahmanic-beliefs-in-nāmarūpa-less-consciousness'>Brahmanic beliefs in nāmarūpa-less consciousness</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Before addressing the other dependency—depencency 1, that of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> on consciousness—it will be helpful to consider the historical context of these teachings. As said before, the Buddha did not teach in a social vacuum. Most if not all of his teachings are dialectical, which means they were formed as a reply to others. When the Buddha said consciousness depends on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, this was also dialectical. He was specifically addressing Brahmanic beliefs, because some Brahmins thought that by shedding their “name and form” at death they could merge with a kind of universal objectless consciousness. This has been pointed out by various scholars of Buddhism,<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325" role="doc-noteref"><sup>325</sup></a> and was summarized by Venerable Sujato as follows:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The terminology of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was adopted by the Buddha from the pre-Buddhist Upaniṣadic philosophy. In the Upaniṣads, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the limited and diverse ‘names’ and ‘shapes’ in the world, each of which has its own identity, like a river; but for the enlightened [Brahmin] they flow and merge together into infinite consciousness, like the great ocean. In stating that consciousness was itself dependent on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, the Buddha was turning this Upaniṣadic idea on its head. Consciousness is not an independent metaphysical absolute, but a part of everyday empirical reality, as fragile and dependent as anything else.<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326" role="doc-noteref"><sup>326</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In other words, Brahmins believed that their name and form separated them from a universal nameless and shapeless existence. Abandoning these aspects of one’s being was thought to bring the Brahmin to an everlasting state of unity with a sort of infinite consciousness. This happened at death but was prepared for in life by gaining knowledge about the process beforehand. In the book <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Nāma-rūpa and Dharma-rūpa</span>, Maryla Falk explained that the process was believed to happen in two steps. First one’s form, one’s body, was abandoned, thereafter one’s name:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The first part of the process […] follow[s] the dissolution of the organic frame [i.e. the death of the body] whose functions [e.g. awareness] are now unified with the vijñānamaya ātma [the self made of consciousness]. The second part of this process of mukta [liberation] goes beyond this sphere of rūpaless unity […] and abuts in the sphere of the transcendent Purusa [the heavenly Person] the attainment of the transcendent sphere […] the utter abandonment of both rūpa and nāma.<a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327" role="doc-noteref"><sup>327</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Unlike Buddhism, the Upaniṣads were not the creation of a single person but of various spiritual leaders, who did not always have the exact same ideas.<a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328" role="doc-noteref"><sup>328</sup></a> As a result this process of liberation may be detailed variously throughout the Upaniṣads. Not all Brahmins aimed for the absolution of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> either. Many pursued more worldly aims or still the older Vedic goal of an eternal afterlife amongst one’s forefathers. But the ultimate goal of at least <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">some</span> Brahmins was to release themselves from “name and form” so that only pure consciousness remained, in an everlasting state of unity with the heavenly “Person”, also known as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">brahman</span>, ‘the supreme’. (The word ‘Person’ is symbolic. It was by these Brahmins not regarded as a real person or even personal god, but more like the source of consciousness itself.) It was these heterodox Brahmins the Buddha was primarily addressing when explaining that consciousness always depends on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>For clarification, here are some relevant passages from the Upaniṣads, translated by Patrick Olivelle:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>As the rivers flow on and enter into the ocean<br>

In just the same way, these sixteen parts of the person who is the perceiver [i.e. consciousness] proceed toward the Person and, upon reaching him, merge into that person, losing their names and visible appearances; one simply calls it the person. He then becomes partless [i.e. infinite] and immortal.<a href="#fn330" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330" role="doc-noteref"><sup>330</sup></a></p>

<p>After introducing <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in <span data-custom-style="internal-reference">Chapter 3</span>, I mentioned that in the Upaniṣads the term can also refer to the names and forms of <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">objects</span>, not just of individual beings. It could be that the abandoning of such concepts is also implied in these passages, but in the last passage the idea is abandoning one’s personal name and form, since it talks about beings no longer identifying with their own names, like ‘tiger’ or ‘wolf’ (or ‘Sue’ or ‘Harry’). This passage is also the only one coming from what is generally accepted to be a pre-Buddhist <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣad</span>, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Chāndogya</span>.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Buddha never quotes the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span> verbatim, but he appears to have been well aware of some of them, or at least of their general purport.

<p>This statement, which reflects the standard eternalist belief in the Canon, directly refutes Brahmanical ideas about a universal self. With the dependency of consciousness on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> the Buddha was also addressing such ideas. While Brahmins believed that the abandonment of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> would result in a state of transcendent consciousness, the Buddha taught that consciousness is intrinsically dependent on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>, so that their abandonment results in the cessation of consciousness. Existence is always a combination of consciousness <span data-custom-style="Strong">and</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.

<p>The same essential teaching is given in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>, which I discussed at length in a previous essay, although without detailing its connections to Brahmanism.<a href="#fn338" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338" role="doc-noteref"><sup>338</sup></a> The discourse stems from the first section of <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Dīgha Nikāya</span>, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sīlakkhandha Vagga</span>, which is aimed at converting outsiders, Brahmins in particular.<a href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339" role="doc-noteref"><sup>339</sup></a> In the relevant part of the discourse the Buddha tells Kevaddha a story in which he shows his knowledge to surpass that of Brahmā. This indicates that the discourse specifically addresses Brahmanical ideas. In the story, which I take to be symbolic, an unnamed monk travels to Brahmā to ask him how to get liberated from earth, water, fire, and air, which represent form. Brahmā doesn’t know and sends the monk to the Buddha. The story intends to illustrate, among other things, that the Buddha’s teachings surpass those of the Brahmins. This context helps us understand the primary message of the discourse.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the story the Buddha speaks the following verses to the monk:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">

<p>The explanation for that is:</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To summarize the conclusions of my earlier essay, these verses contain two separate questions and answers. The first answer describes a state of consciousness where the four elements (i.e. form) cannot infiltrate or “find no footing”. This is the state of unbounded consciousness, the second formless attainment. (In this context form goes beyond the body and also includes a mental perception of “bounded” space.)<a href="#fn341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341" role="doc-noteref"><sup>341</sup></a> The second answer describes the cessation of all consciousness, including unbounded consciousness, at which time <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> ceases too. This reflects the standard dependency of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> on consciousness, just as taught to Ajita.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Richard Gombrich already observed that “the opening statement of the answer seems <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">prima facie</span> to reify consciousness and the language sounds as if it could come from an <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣad</span>”.<a href="#fn342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342" role="doc-noteref"><sup>342</sup></a> He did not provide further sources, but I have no doubt these verses indeed reference Brahmanic ideas. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</span>, the Brahmin sage Yājñavalkya describes the highest form of existence as “an unbounded, limitless mass of consciousness” and also calls it “neither fine nor coarse, neither long nor short”, in both cases using the direct Sanskrit equivalents of the terms used in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>.<a href="#fn343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343" role="doc-noteref"><sup>343</sup></a> He also describes this form of existence as being different from, and uninfluenced by, the four elements.<a href="#fn344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344" role="doc-noteref"><sup>344</sup></a> Further, the Taittirīya Upaniṣad calls this highest essence “invisible”, i.e., without appearance.<a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref345" role="doc-noteref"><sup>345</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is a bit more speculative, but the term ‘all-shining’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabbato pabhaṁ</span>) might have a link with a statement from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Chāndogya Upaniṣad</span>: “Far above here [is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">brahman</span>] the light that shines from heaven on the backs of everything, on the backs of all (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabba</span>) things, in the very highest of the high worlds—it is clearly this very same light here within a man. […] This self of mine that lies deep within my heart—it is made of mind, […] luminous is its appearance.”<a href="#fn346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref346" role="doc-noteref"><sup>346</sup></a> It seems one idea here is that this consciousness makes awareness of things in the world possible. It “illuminates” them, making them in a sense visible. However, the term ‘all-shining’, which to Yājñavalkya would have implied a pure eternal entity, to the Buddha merely referred to the purity of a temporal experience.<a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref347" role="doc-noteref"><sup>347</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Yājñavalkya’s unbounded consciousness likely differed from the Buddha’s, not only philosophically but also in practice, because the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span> seem to indicate Yājñavalkya arrived at it through reason rather than meditation.<a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348" role="doc-noteref"><sup>348</sup></a> But regardless, the Buddha did use the exact same terminology, which indicates he (or whoever composed the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>) was very familiar with these Brahmanic ideas and was addressing them directly.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Before I explain exactly how the Buddha responded to these ideas, it is worth noting that although Brahmins called the highest goal a self (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ātman</span>), this did not mean that the person continued forever as a separate individual, a personal self. The term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ātman</span> had several senses. Any type of essence of the being was called a ‘self’. The goal was an impersonal attainment, the ultimate conscious state of existence. Karel Werner wrote: “There is no trace of the individual in it, even though [it] is an individual experience accessible at the moment of its duration just to that one particular person.”<a href="#fn349" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref349" role="doc-noteref"><sup>349</sup></a> Yājñavalkya himself said: “It is to be seen by the mind alone that nothing exists separately here. […] It is to be seen as just oneness, immeasurable and constant. The self is stainless, beyond space, unborn, immense, constant.”<a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350" role="doc-noteref"><sup>350</sup></a> This supposed eternal, unborn, immeasurable experience, although called a self, therefore was also in a sense self-less. That is exactly why in order to attain it, one’s personal name and form had to be abandoned, leaving only unbounded consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Gombrich also commented on the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span> that “it is a bit risky to take a riddle or its solution as a philosophical tenet or argument”.<a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351" role="doc-noteref"><sup>351</sup></a> I wholeheartedly embrace this sentiment in general, but in this particular case the overall meaning seems clear enough to me. My interpretation of these verses is also a safe one, for rather than taking them as a unique statement on the nature of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbāna</span>, it aligns with the Buddha’s overall teachings. In short, he acknowledged the existence of an unbounded consciousness but denied its unconditioned nature. To the Buddha all consciousness is dependently arisen, including unbounded consciousness. His actual response to the Brahmanic ideas is therefore two final lines of verse: “when consciousness ceases, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">then</span> those come to cease”. While Yājñavalkya’s goal was a type of consciousness free from name and form, his goal was the cessation of consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>However, some suggest the Buddha’s final goal was <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">also</span> a state of unbounded consciousness, and these verses are often taken as primary evidence for that. As I discussed in the essay, this is a consequence of interpreting the two answer verses as a single answer instead of two separate ones. I actually suspect this was intended to happen, to a certain extent. That is because, as Gombrich noticed, the verses seem like they’re right in line with Brahmanic beliefs… but only until the final two lines are added! If we remove those lines, we get: “Unbounded consciousness, without appearance, all-shining: here earth, water, fire, and air find no footing. Here the long and short, the fine and coarse, the fair and ugly, here the immaterial aspects and body fully come to cease.” This sounds exactly like Yājñavalkya’s neither-fine-nor-coarse, neither-long nor-short unbounded mass of consciousness which is untouched by the four elements. However! The addition of “when consciousness ceases, then those come to cease”, completely changes the meaning of the verses. They now have to be read as two different answers, in the way I suggested. It’s like the Buddha said, “I got something… stolen from me.” The meaning is only revealed at the end, and it turns the goal from a presence of something (an unbounded consciousness) into an absence.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To conclude this little detour into Brahmanic thought, it is important to keep in mind that the Buddha spoke to a certain audience. When we put his teachings into practice, they can sometimes feel so alive, it is easy to assume everything he said is timeless, as relevant today as ever. But while such a mindset may be inspiring for the practitioner, it is problematic when interpreting ancient texts. Although it is true that the deep truths the Buddha’s teachings point at have remained unchanged, the pointers themselves are sometimes a bit outdated. As a result some of the pragmatic implications of these teachings are lost on us. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nāmarūpa</span> is a good example. If the Buddha were to teach in our day and age, he would not speak about “name and form”, since most of us aren’t Brahmins aiming to leave our “name and form” behind to reach a state of unconditioned consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>What has remained very relevant, however, is the general idea that consciousness can’t exist in isolation, because some Buddhists believe the Buddha taught the highest goal to be some consciousness free from objects or content.<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352" role="doc-noteref"><sup>352</sup></a> But it was the Brahmins who did so, not the Buddha. The Buddha said all consciousness is dependently arisen. Or, as he chose to put it, consciousness depends on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-dependency-of-nāmarūpa-on-consciousness'>The dependency of nāmarūpa on consciousness</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Also connected to some ancient concepts, although to a lesser extent, is <span data-custom-style="Strong">dependency 1</span>, that of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> (the body and other individual aspects of a being) on consciousness. This dependency is part of the standard sequence of Dependent Arising, where it is phrased as: “Dependent on consciousness, there are the individual’s immaterial aspects and body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṁ</span>).” In isolation this statement is rather non-explanatory, so how should it be understood?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The passage of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> on conception in the womb (§84) contains the most detailed explanation of this dependency in the Pāli Canon. Quite significantly, before giving this explanation the Buddha says: “I said the individual’s immaterial aspects and body depend on consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṁ</span>), which is to be understood <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">as follows</span>.” This indicates that whenever the phrase <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṁ</span> occurs, such as in the standard sequence, it should be understood in line with the explanation given in the Mahānidāna Sutta. Since there is no other direct explanation of this dependency in the canon, this passage should not be lightly swept aside. It is not merely an example of the dependency of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> on consciousness,<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353" role="doc-noteref"><sup>353</sup></a> but the foremost explanation in the canon.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In <span data-custom-style="internal-reference">Chapter 3</span> I showed that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the individual being, and in the last chapter I discussed the rebirth of consciousness. In this passage these two ideas come together. The Buddha describes the “entry” (or ‘conception’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">avakkanti</span>) of consciousness at the immaterial aspects and body inside the mother’s womb, mentioning various words already familiar to us: ‘produced’, ‘conception’, ‘consciousness is planted’, and even ‘develop, sprout, and mature’, which all refer to rebirth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The primary message is that a being is not born out of nowhere. It had a past life, a past consciousness. This consciousness (or spirit, we might say more freely) is what gets reborn in the new life and thereby becomes a conditioning factor for the rest of the individual. Without consciousness continuing on in such a way, if it were “cut off” in the womb, there can be no new life. This specifically refutes the materialistic understanding of life, the assumption that the being is just physical stuff, a view mentioned regularly in the canon as being wrong.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354" role="doc-noteref"><sup>354</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>We find another pragmatic application of this link when we consider that consciousness itself depends on willful actions. We aren’t just “thrown” into the world, to use a Heideggerian term. We were born in this human life because our past will and intention drove us here. If we remain attached to the human realm—to our country, our families, our body, our five senses, and so on—then our will and intentions are likely to be directed towards another human life. Our consciousness will be reborn in a womb again.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Consciousness-as-the-carrier-of-life'>Consciousness as the carrier of life</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There is a little language barrier between Pāli and English here, for in English we do not use the word ‘consciousness’ to describe what gets reborn, and are more likely to use something like ‘spirit’ or ‘mind’ instead. We do not say things like “the rebirth of consciousness” or “consciousness is conceived in the womb”. In Pāli, however, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> has a wider meaning than just consciousness in the sense of awareness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>First of all, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> can also stand for the mind more generally. In some instances it is used as a direct synonym for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">mano</span>, both commonly translated as ‘mind’.<a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355" role="doc-noteref"><sup>355</sup></a> It is also said that the consciousness of the unenlightened becomes preoccupied with change.<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356" role="doc-noteref"><sup>356</sup></a> In such instances consciousness stands for something more than the plain awareness it signifies as one of the five aspects of existence. It represents the whole mind, including its perceptions, thoughts, and sensations. In at least one passage, the Thai Pāli manuscripts even use <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> where other editions have <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>.<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357" role="doc-noteref"><sup>357</sup></a> The Āgamas sometimes also use ‘mind’ (心) as a translation for what must in the original have been <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> or its Sanskrit equivalent <span data-custom-style="wwc-sanskrit">vijñāna</span>.<a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref358" role="doc-noteref"><sup>358</sup></a> Also deserving consideration is a discourse in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Satipaṭṭhāna Saṁyutta</span> where not <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> but <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> is said to depend on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>: “The mind (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>) originates from the immaterial aspects and body. The mind will disappear if the immaterial aspects and body cease.”<a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref359" role="doc-noteref"><sup>359</sup></a> The context here is a little different, but it is an alternative way to phrase the dependency of consciousness on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> being a synonym for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Aside from referring to the mind in general, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> was also a name for the surviving aspect of the being, or as Venerable Anālayo describes it, “what provides the transition from one body to another”.<a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360" role="doc-noteref"><sup>360</sup></a> The suttas mention “the body with consciousness”, consciousness is said to be bound to the body as long as one is alive, and the person dies when consciousness (and vitality and heat) leave the body.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361" role="doc-noteref"><sup>361</sup></a> It is also said that consciousness roams and transmigrates in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>; that it passes on and gets reborn; that it travels on after death; and, in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, that it enters the womb.<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362" role="doc-noteref"><sup>362</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The PTS Pāli-English Dictionary therefore glosses under <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>, before discussing more analytical meanings of the word: “the bearer of (individual) life, life-force (as extending also over rebirths), principle of conscious life, […] mind as transmigrant, […] In this (fundamental) application it may be characterized as the sensory and perceptive activity commonly expressed by ‘mind’. It is difficult to give any one word for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>, because there is much difference between the old Buddhist and our modern points of view, and there is a varying use of the term in the Canon itself.”<a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363" role="doc-noteref"><sup>363</sup></a> Many scholars have echoed these observations,<a href="#fn364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364" role="doc-noteref"><sup>364</sup></a> and Kalupahana summarized: “At least three important uses of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> can be clearly distinguished. First, it is used to denote psychic phenomena in general, synonymous with the terms <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>, ‘mind’, and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">mano</span>, ‘thought’. Second, it is used to describe a complete act of perception or cognition [i.e. instances of awareness]; and third, it stands for the connecting link between two lives.”<a href="#fn365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365" role="doc-noteref"><sup>365</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reason <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> was used to indicate what travels between lives, is that awareness seems to be a constant.<a href="#fn366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366" role="doc-noteref"><sup>366</sup></a> This subjective feeling of continuity made people think consciousness was permanent and would keep existing after death. The Buddha knew consciousness to be impermanent and ever-changing, but he did not shy away from using the term in a more conventional sense as well. Just like with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, he did not introduce the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> but adopted it from society, where it already had various meanings. After all, to get new ideas across you have to start with some shared terminology. “In order to make himself understood the Buddha had to talk in terms with which his audiences were already familiar,” wrote Gombrich.<a href="#fn367" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref367" role="doc-noteref"><sup>367</sup></a> In this case, the audience was already familiar with using <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> to refer to what survives death.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Thai nowadays also use <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> (วิญญาณ) to refer to the surviving spirit. The English word ‘consciousness’ ill fits such contexts,<a href="#fn368" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref368" role="doc-noteref"><sup>368</sup></a> and according to Schmithausen might even be considered misleading: “This <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> [of Dependent Arising] is somewhat misleadingly rendered as ‘Wahrnehmung’ [‘consciousness/awareness’], because it primarily concerns a subtle carrier of life.”<a href="#fn369" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref369" role="doc-noteref"><sup>369</sup></a> It might be unintuitive for a word to have multiple meanings which no single English term can encapsulate, but as long as we keep the language gap in mind, the essential ideas behind the factor of consciousness are clear enough. In the discourses it includes more than just moments of awareness, referring also to the mind or life-force that travels from one life to the next.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This meaning of consciousness applies not only to its links with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> but also to its link with willful actions. As Frauwallner stated: “Out of these passages we get the valuable information that knowledge [Frauwallner’s translation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>] in the oldest Buddhism is the essential bearer of the cycle of existence, which enters in the next embodiment after death […]. From these cited passages, the chain of causes is understood as follows: the impulses of the will (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>) as the cause of knowledge (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>) do <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">not</span> call forth knowledge itself [in the moment] but <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">only</span> bring about its entry into the mother’s womb.”<a href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370" role="doc-noteref"><sup>370</sup></a> In §55 &amp; §56 consciousness was said to travel on to a certain place after death depending on one’s willful actions. This rebirth of consciousness is what Frauwallner is talking about.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The same general principle also applies to the planting or establishing of consciousness in a certain realm. Hamilton wrote: “The individual life is sometimes expressed by stating that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> is ‘stationed’ [or ‘planted’]: the centrality of consciousness allows it to be used as a general metaphor for an entire life.”<a href="#fn371" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref371" role="doc-noteref"><sup>371</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The cessation sequence also confirms that the factor of consciousness concerns the entire life, not the arising of individual instances of consciousness. Otherwise enlightened beings, who have no more ignorance and resultant willful actions, would have lost all consciousness the moment they became enlightened. But consciousness instead only ceases when they pass away.<a href="#fn372" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref372" role="doc-noteref"><sup>372</sup></a> Therefore, the phrase “if willful actions cease, consciousness will cease” means that consciousness will cease <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">at death</span>, as a result of (ignorant) willful actions ceasing at an earlier time. By extent, in the origination sequence, the factor of consciousness also does not refer to the arising of instances of consciousness. It refers to the start of life, to the arising of the entire aspect of existence of consciousness.<a href="#fn373" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref373" role="doc-noteref"><sup>373</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All that said, I think the commentaries get too technical when specifically calling the consciousness of Dependent Arising ‘linking consciousness’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paṭisandhi-viññāṇa</span>), by which they mean it links the past life to the new one.<a href="#fn374" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref374" role="doc-noteref"><sup>374</sup></a> The commentaries correctly understand that the factor of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> focuses on rebirth, but the Buddha phrased things more generally. Consciousness as a factor of Dependent Arising still refers to the aspect of existence of consciousness, which does not just link lives together but also continues to exist in the new life. The arising of consciousness as a result of willful actions is the general continuation of this aspect of existence into a next life, not a separate type of ‘linking consciousness’ that exists only for a moment or so.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In a similar spirit, although the suttas call the process that continues from life to life ‘consciousness’, this does not mean that consciousness exists without other aspects of existence at any point in time. Between lives consciousness still depends on other things, including some subtle form of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. However, such technical considerations about the in-between state are not what the standard sequence intends to convey, where the arising of consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> concerns their continuance into a new life.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Consciousness-as-a-stream'>Consciousness as a stream</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Using ‘consciousness’ to refer to the process that continues from life to life has a downside, however, because it can be mistaken to refer to some entity or self, like some Brahmins believed consciousness to be. The Brahmins used the term in similar ways as the Buddha, as the transmigrating aspect of the being, but to them it signified a permanent entity, while the Buddha understood consciousness to be an impermanent process. “There is no doubt that the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣadic</span> tradition took the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vijñāna</span> as the surviving factor at death in the metaphysical sense of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ātman</span> [self] that leaves the body at death”, wrote Wijesekera. “Thus it is easy to see how the Buddhist theory of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> as the surviving factor shows a distinct difference from the parallel Upaniṣadic concept.”<a href="#fn375" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref375" role="doc-noteref"><sup>375</sup></a> The difference being that the Buddhist <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> lacks any constancy or self.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is not strange the Brahmins had such absolutist ideas. As said earlier, for unenlightened beings there is this <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">sense</span> of sameness, this watcher or knower people feel is behind all of their experiences. That very sameness is what the Brahmins also felt. They concluded this consciousness was indestructible and would continue unchanged after death. They (or more likely society at large) were already using the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> in this sense before the Buddha appeared on the scene. He then challenged these preexisting ideas in various ways but without completely changing the terminology.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Here is an example from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>What is that self? It is this person—the one that consists of consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vijñāna</span>) among the vital functions, the one that is the inner light within the heart. […] When at birth this person [i.e. the consciousness] takes on a body, he becomes united with bad things, and when at death he leaves it behind, he gets rid of those bad things.<a href="#fn376" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref376" role="doc-noteref"><sup>376</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving</span>, a monk named Sāti has such a view. “It is this unchanging consciousness that roams and transmigrates”, he claims. “It is he [i.e. the person/self] who speaks, he who feels, who in various realms experiences the results of good and bad deeds.”<a href="#fn377" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref377" role="doc-noteref"><sup>377</sup></a> The Buddha rebukes Sāti, saying consciousness is not an unchanging entity. It is inconstant and fluctuating, with its contents depending on changing objects of awareness. As Vetter explained:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Perception [Vetter’s translation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>] was thought of as transmigrating (perhaps accompanied by faint feeling, apperception and emotions). This perception was seen as a kind of substance, though not (or, no longer) as unchanging [by the Buddha]. This is a relic of an ancient idea that ‘perception’, as the subtlest part of a person, is the transmigratory entity. […] But we must be cautious. This part of the twelvefold chain, though showing traces of old ideas, probably presupposes discriminating insight at a stage where ‘perception’ was considered transient as well. In this sense the monk Sāti is rightly criticized […] for stating that it is always this same ‘perception’ which transmigrates.<a href="#fn378" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref378" role="doc-noteref"><sup>378</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Buddha tells Sāti that consciousness occurs dependent on the objects of the six senses, describing the arising of different types of consciousness depending on sense impressions. (This is a different concept from consciousness arising dependent on willful actions, as the next chapter illustrates.) The Buddha effectively tells Sāti that consciousness is not a constant entity but an ever-changing stream of unique instances that succeed one another.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sampasādanīya Sutta</span>, although the passage is abstract and lacks context, Sāriputta indeed mentions a stream of consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇasota</span>) that can be planted in this world or another world.<a href="#fn379" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref379" role="doc-noteref"><sup>379</sup></a> The analogy with a stream is apt, because as Heraclitus’ famous saying goes, you can’t step in the same river twice. A stream of water seems to be a solid entity, yet the water flowing in it is never the same. Similarly, consciousness may <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">seem</span> to be continuous, but in reality it constantly changes.<a href="#fn380" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref380" role="doc-noteref"><sup>380</sup></a> As the Buddha said: “What is called ‘mind’, ‘sentience’, and also ‘consciousness’, that arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and night.”<a href="#fn381" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref381" role="doc-noteref"><sup>381</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This important principle—that there is no constancy or self in consciousness, yet it still transmigrates—has sometimes been misunderstood by writers challenging the multiple-lifetime interpretation of Dependent Arising. They claim that this interpretation necessarily entails an eternalist view that sees a stable self in consciousness, similar to the view of Sāti.<a href="#fn382" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref382" role="doc-noteref"><sup>382</sup></a> But such arguments are just semantics. Streams of water are ever-changing, but we can still use the word ‘stream’ to point to this impermanent phenomena. Likewise, we can use the term ‘consciousness’ without implying a self. Notice also that the Buddha actually didn’t challenge Sāti’s statement that consciousness transmigrates. He only challenged it being a stable entity.<a href="#fn383" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref383" role="doc-noteref"><sup>383</sup></a> As already observed by the PTS Pāli-English Dictionary more than a century ago: “It was [by Sāti] also held to be an immutable, persistent substance, a view strongly condemned [by the Buddha]. Since, however, the persistence of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> from life to life is declared […], we must judge that it is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">only</span> the immutable persistence that is condemned.”<a href="#fn384" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref384" role="doc-noteref"><sup>384</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>We can assume the Brahmanic idea of an unchanging transmigrating consciousness was quite prevalent in the Buddha’s days, given that even a Buddhist monk believed in it. Sāti even thought it was the Buddha’s own teaching! For this reason I think the Buddha’s definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> as the six types of consciousness (§2) was largely a teaching on the absence of a self. It told the audience that consciousness, although it does continue from life to life, is not a fixed entity. It consists of six different types of consciousness. This makes the definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> similar in function to the definitions of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>. Rather than being a technical explanation of the word, it was meant to challenge existing notions about what a person is. As Olalde summarized: “[The Buddha’s] reinterpretation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> mirrors that of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>, in which the older notion of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> as a transmigrating entity was eventually replaced by the sixfold [consciousness].”<a href="#fn385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref385" role="doc-noteref"><sup>385</sup></a> The Buddha’s definitions of ‘consciousness’ and ‘the immaterial aspects and body’ together imply that the whole being is without any fixed essence. In short: one’s “name” is the result of a collection of mental processes, one’s body is an experience of “form” made of the four elements, and one’s consciousness is an ever-changing stream of events. None of these contains an essence or self.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The absence of a self is also implied by the mutual dependence between the factors of consciousness and that of the immaterial aspects and body. Sāriputta once explained this to Koṭṭhita with a simile of two bundles of reeds leaning against one another. We join their conversation after they’ve already gone through the sequence of factors starting at old age and death, having arrived at <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Well then, venerable, I will give you a simile. For some clever people understand the meaning of something through a simile. Like two bundles of reeds leaning against one another, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body depend on consciousness, and consciousness depends on the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. […] If you pull away the left bundle of reeds, the right one falls, and if you pull away the right bundle of reeds, the left one falls.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The exchange between these venerable monks may benefit from some clarification. To start, it is interesting to note that according to the Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names, Koṭṭhita was also born a Brahmin, just like Sāriputta.<a href="#fn387" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref387" role="doc-noteref"><sup>387</sup></a> So again these teachings on consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> may be addressing Brahmin views. The terms ‘made by oneself’ and ‘made by another’ to Brahmins would have meant made by the person’s own self or by higher powers in the universe, like a creator god or <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">brahman</span>.<a href="#fn388" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref388" role="doc-noteref"><sup>388</sup></a> Sāriputta explains that no self or higher power underlies consciousness or the immaterial aspects and body. Instead, they rely on one another, like bundles of reeds leaning against each other.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The imagery was probably derived from farmers drying bundles of hay in a field. Just like the simile of the seed, it was something people could link directly to their experience of the world. The simile has its limits, though, because if you pull away one physical bundle of reeds, the other will fall to the ground, but it will still exist. With consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, however, if one ends, the other also completely ceases.</p>

<p>In the following illustration I added the mutual dependency to the tower of bricks. This reminds us that consciousness and the individual’s immaterial aspects &amp; body rely not just on one another but also on willful actions. That is also why Sāriputta said these factors do not arise at random. Although there is no self, where the being is reborn is not random, because it is still determined by actions and intentions.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The dependency of the immaterial aspects and body on consciousness is not just an absolute dependency but also a conditioning dependency. By this I mean, consciousness does not just underlie the mere existence of the immaterial aspects and body; it also shapes them. The being’s willful actions determine where their consciousness takes rebirth, which in turn determines the quality of their immaterial aspects and body.</p>

<p>When the bottom bricks are pulled away, it takes some time for the tower to topple to the ground. Similarly, when ignorance and willful actions are removed, the cessation of consciousness along with the immaterial aspects and body does not occur at the very same instant.

For now, the next verses connect understanding and knowledge (that is, the cessation of ignorance) to the cessation of existence and to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.

<p>It is not unusual for verses to leave some things open to interpretation. In this case neither the brahmin nor the Buddha explicitly explains what it means to be entangled in the inside and outside. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Visuddhimagga</span> has a somewhat uninspired take on this, thinking it refers to craving for things of one’s own and things of others. I suggest something a bit more poetic. The inner tangle is indeed the defilements in the mind including craving, but the external tangle refers to existence, to being stuck in the “external” world. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> refers to this, saying people are entangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, being stuck in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.<a href="#fn395" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref395" role="doc-noteref"><sup>395</sup></a> There are two different tangles, then, but since they are closely connected, the rest of the discourse refers to them just as ‘the tangle’.</p>

<p>Bhāradvāja only asks who <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">can</span> untangle the tangle. This question is already answered in the Buddha’s first verse, but he then adds two more.
