<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Dependent Arising is one of the Buddha’s most important and central doctrines, but in recent decades it has been interpreted in a large variety of ways. This book illustrates that the early Buddhist texts support the traditional multiple-lifetime interpretation of this teaching, taking a particular interest in the factor of consciousness. Centered around three similes, it connects this factor to rebirth and explains how it relates to the other factors of Dependent Arising. It also explains that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, a term used in the similes, refers to the cessation of consciousness.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>About three years ago I wrote a rather technical essay on an obscure pair of Pāli words, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa anidassana</span>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> These words are sometimes understood to describe a kind of consciousness of <span data-custom-style="wwc-sanskrit">nirvāṇa</span>, but I argued they refer to a state of meditation instead. I expected few to be interested in such technical analysis, but it was surprisingly well received. Afterwards I was asked to explain a similar pair of words that gets likewise misunderstood, namely <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>. Initially I was reluctant to do more of the same, but then realized it would be a good opportunity to illustrate some aspects of the Buddha’s teachings which continue to amaze me and which may also amaze the reader, because this subject is a good example of how interconnected his teachings are, of how words and concepts reappear throughout the discourses, illuminating the same ideas from different angles. It also gives me a chance to showcase the Buddha’s beautiful use of metaphors for even the deepest of concepts, hopefully shedding some light on the more enigmatic parts of his teachings on Dependent Arising.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As such, this writing is not meant to be a critique but a constructive step towards a better understanding and appreciation of the Buddha’s teachings. But for context, let me briefly lay out the views I consider to be mistaken. The assumption is that enlightened beings experience a certain kind of objectless or contentless consciousness which the Buddha called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, usually translated by proponents of the idea as ‘unestablished consciousness’.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Some further think this consciousness lies outside of conditioned phenomena and will continue to exist after the enlightened being passes away. Often referenced in support of these ideas is a passage wherein the Buddha supposedly compares this unestablished consciousness to a beam of light that does not land on any surface.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With this book I wish not to be argumentative but aim to present an alternative interpretation of the terms and simile in question. At some occasions, however, I do address the idea of an objectless consciousness directly. This was inevitable, because in my understanding the Buddha specifically denied the existence of such a consciousness, and this happens to be the exact point he was making with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>. I will show that the term refers not to an unestablished consciousness but to the non-establishing of consciousness in any object or place, particularly at the enlightened being’s time of death, after which there will be no rebirth and hence no more consciousness. Also involved is a simile in which consciousness is a seed for rebirth, where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> is more aptly translated as ‘consciousness is not planted’.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All this is explained in three parts:</p>
</div>
<ol type="I">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The first part introduces the wider context of Dependent Arising and a simile of painting a picture of a person, which illustrates the creation of rebirth. It also provides some historical context for the factor of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, quite literally ‘name and form’, translated here as ‘the (individual’s) immaterial aspects and body’.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The second part explains the simile of the seed of consciousness, clarifying that this simile, like that of the painting, illustrates rebirth too. It also discusses the dependent existence of all consciousness, the impossibility for consciousness to be without object or content.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The third part gives my interpretation of the disputed simile of the light beam, showing that this simile implies the cessation of consciousness. Some connected statements on the final goal are also touched upon.</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Since this writing is essentially a patchwork of translations and notes made over the span of nearly a decade, there will be a few tangents along the way as well. My hope is that these will not distract from the main ideas but add to them instead. Some of these tangents may also reflect that I am not an academic but a practitioner interested in the real-life application of these texts and that I write with a similar audience in mind. Still, please know that this is first and foremost a study of texts, not a guide to practice. A proper understanding of the texts can guide the practitioner in the right direction, however. If anything, I hope you will find some inspiration in the Buddha’s rich metaphors.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, quotations of the Buddhist canonical texts should be attributed to the Buddha. All translations of the Pāli, including any inevitable shortcomings in them, are my own. Unfamiliar translations will always raise some questions, but to not interrupt the continuity of ideas, I will not explain every translation choice I made and include the Pāli terms only when deemed relevant. Some translations directly connected to the topic are explained in the endnotes, which further contain only references to the source texts and contemporary works.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Realizing that the Pāli Canon is not infallible, I also consulted the Chinese Āgamas, assisted by English translations of others. My knowledge of these texts is limited, so I cannot claim this to be a proper comparative study of early texts—nor was it intended to be—but some interesting observations were made regardless. I hope this will encourage a wider recognition of the Chinese canon and less reliance on unique Pāli passages.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>My highest wish, and the real purpose behind this book, is for the Buddha’s words to help the reader find the escape from suffering. I will share some further thoughts on this in the conclusion.</p>

<p>A handful of <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">suttas</span> in the Pāli Canon contain <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, the term which I intend to show does not refer to an unestablished consciousness of <span data-custom-style="wwc-sanskrit">nirvāṇa</span> (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbāna</span> in Pāli) but to the cessation of consciousness. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> (<a href="#bqseg23"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§23</span></a>) will be our main focus, because it contains the disputed simile of the light beam that does not hit anything.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But first an important point on the five aggregates: form, sensation, perception, will, and consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa, vedanā, saññā, saṇkhāra, viññāna</span>). Most readers will be familiar with them, but many may not know why the Buddha called them ‘aggregates’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>). The suttas say they are so called because they include, or they “aggregate”, all the different types of the item in question.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> A <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandha</span> is literally a heap or a collection. The aggregate of perception, for example, is the collection of all perceptions. The same principle applies to the aggregate of consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>):</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§1</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The aggregate of consciousness includes any type of consciousness whatsoever—whether past, present, or future; here or elsewhere; internal or external; coarse or subtle; lowly or sublime. That is how the term ‘aggregate’ applies to the aggregates.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>That this statement is intended to be all-encompassing is clarified even further elsewhere when the Buddha says: “any type of consciousness whatsoever—whether past, present, or future [and so on]—<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">all</span> consciousness …”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Similar phrases are spoken of the other four aggregates, so if we were to suppose some special type of consciousness that’s excluded from the aggregate of consciousness,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> we also open the door for similar types of form, sensation, perception, and will. We then have to admit that the definitions of the other aggregates are also not all-encompassing. But this is not the intent behind these statements, which the Buddha meant to be comprehensive. As said, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">all</span> types of consciousness are included in the aggregates, just like all types of form, sensation, perception, and will.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Accordingly, throughout the entire corpus the Buddha never tells his audience there is a consciousness outside of the aggregates. In one discourse a god called Baka seems to claim there is such a consciousness, but the Buddha disagrees with him.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Whenever he uses the word ‘consciousness’, it always refers either to the whole aggregate of consciousness or otherwise to a certain part of it. This is the whole purpose of his definition of the aggregate: to make sure we don’t leave any type of consciousness out.</p>

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Consciousness-in-the-If-There-is-Desire-Discourse'>Consciousness in the If There is Desire Discourse</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>That ‘consciousness’ refers to the aggregate is even more clearly the case for the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>. It is located in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>, the connected discourses on Dependent Arising, and in this context ‘consciousness’ is repeatedly and explicitly defined as the consciousnesses of the six senses—which is to say, as the aggregate of consciousness:<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p><span id="bqseg2" class="anchor"></span>And what is consciousness? There are six kinds of consciousness: sight-consciousness, hearing-consciousness, smell-consciousness, taste-consciousness, touch-consciousness, and mind-consciousness.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Throughout the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>, including the simile of the light beam and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, ‘consciousness’ refers to this aggregate. We are not dealing with a special type of consciousness that is outside of this aggregate (or outside of this ‘aspect of existence’, as I will translate <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandha</span> from here on).</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Moreover, the discourse contains not just the simile of the light beam which is sometimes taken to describe a type of “unestablished” consciousness of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbāna</span>. It is preceded by a simile of a painting which describes an <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">establishing</span> of consciousness. With this information the well-informed reader may already be able to tell what is going on, once they recall that the discourse is on Dependent Arising. In brief, the simile of the painting illustrates the origination sequence of Dependent Arising; the simile of the light beam illustrates the cessation sequence. The former sequence includes the arising of consciousness; the latter includes its ceasing. So <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> is actually about the cessation of consciousness.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All this will be explained in detail in this book. But before we consider the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> and its similes, we need a general understanding of Dependent Arising first.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Chapter 1 test In my opinion the best way to explain Dependent Arising—also called Dependent Origination—is by starting with the second noble truth (or ‘noble one’s truth’, as I translate <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ariyasacca</span>).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This truth tells us that the cause of suffering is the craving that leads to a next life:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what is the noble one’s truth of the origin of suffering?

<p>And what is the noble one’s truth of the origin of suffering? Dependent on ignorance, there are willful actions. Dependent on willful actions, [the continuation of] consciousness.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Dependent Arising is often believed to be a very complicated teaching, but it is not. It’s very <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">deep</span>, very hard to see, but it should not be theoretically difficult. As said, it is essentially an explanation of the second truth of the noble one, and explanations should not be much more complicated than the thing they try to explain!</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Venerable Sāriputta once explained the fundamental principles of Dependent Arising quite succinctly:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§5</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg5" class="anchor"></span>The Buddha said: ‘If you see the dependent arising of things,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> you see the Dhamma [the truth/teaching]. If you see the Dhamma, you see the dependent arising of things.’ And what has dependently arisen are these five taken up aspects of existence. Wanting them and holding on to them, being attracted and attached to them, will make suffering originate. Removing and abandoning the want and desire for them, will make suffering cease.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The arising of the five aspects of existence here means their overall existence. By this I mean, Sāriputta is talking about the origination of these aspects of existence <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">as a whole</span>, not about momentary changes within them. This origination of the aspects of existence happens at the start of life, when one is born. This is reflected by the definition of ‘birth’ in <a href="#bqseg20"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§20</span></a>, which includes “the manifestation of the aspects of existence”. Sāriputta’s summary of Dependent Arising therefore aligns with the noble one’s second truth, on the craving that leads to <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">a next life</span>. That is to say, Dependent Arising primarily explains why rebirth happens.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another short version of Dependent Arising likewise mentions that the origination of the five aspects of existence happens through birth, which in turn is caused by enjoyment and attachment:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§6</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg6" class="anchor"></span>And what is the origin of form, sensation, perception, will, and consciousness? Then you enjoy, welcome, and keep holding on. You enjoy, welcome, and keep holding on to what?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>You enjoy, welcome, and keep holding on to form. It results in enjoyment, and when there is enjoyment of form, there is fuel/taking up. Dependent on fuel/taking up, there is [further] existence. Dependent on existence, there is birth. And dependent on birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates. [Similar for the other aspects of existence.]<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Because the aspects of existence are suffering which starts (or, more accurately, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">re</span>starts) at birth, the Buddha also said:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§7</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg7" class="anchor"></span>Mendicants, the arising, continuation, production, and manifestation of form is the arising of suffering, the continuation of diseases, and the manifestation of old age and death. The arising, continuation, production, and manifestation of sensation, perception, will, and consciousness is the arising of suffering, the continuation of diseases, and the manifestation of old age and death.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The cessation, subsiding, and disappearance of form is the cessation of suffering, the subsiding of diseases, and the disappearance of old age and death. The cessation, subsiding, and disappearance of sensation, perception, will, and consciousness is the cessation of suffering, the subsiding of diseases, and the disappearance of old age and death.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The arising, continuation, production, and manifestation of the aspects of existence here means their continuation into a new life after death. It is this kind of continuation which results in more deaths: their continuation while one is already alive does not. Accordingly, the words ‘production’ and ‘manifestation’ are also found in the very definition of birth, namely in the phrases ‘the production of beings’ and ‘the manifestation of the aspects of existence’. In fact, the word for ‘production’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhinibbatti</span>) also means ‘rebirth’.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Venerable Sujato translated it as such in the above discourse, and Venerable Bodhi did so elsewhere.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The aspects of existence, and therefore death and other suffering, cease only when the enlightened being passes away. As the Buddha said after the death of the enlightened monk Dabba:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§8</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p><span id="bqseg8" class="anchor"></span>The body fell apart, perception ceased,<br>
all sensations cooled off,<br>
will subsided,<br>
consciousness disappeared.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>When Sāriputta mentioned the cessation of suffering in <a href="#bqseg5"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§5</span></a>, he referred to this final cessation of the aspects of existence. It is only then, after one final death, that old age and death and all suffering are truly overcome.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is important to realize that Dependent Arising explains rebirth and its causes. If we fail to acknowledge this, it becomes impossible to properly understand the Buddha’s similes and terminology, including <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>. But since some prevalent interpretations don’t recognize or otherwise marginalize this central principle, I will return to it throughout this writing, showing in various ways that Dependent Arising indeed focuses on rebirth. My apologies if at some point this becomes repetitious, but I think a topic as important as this deserves to be treated thoroughly.</p>

<p>The sequential arising of these twelve factors is usually followed by their sequential cessation, which has no official name in the discourses. Some have termed it ‘Dependent Cessation’, but I will just call it ‘the cessation sequence’. In the following text the Buddha gives both the arising sequence and cessation sequence in their standard form, after, just like Sāriputta, saying he is concerned with the arising and cessation of the five aspects of existence.</p>

<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">

</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>We can rephrase this more modernly as:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There will be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">B</span>, only if there is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">A</span>. <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">B</span> arises, because <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">A</span> arises.</p>

<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">B</span> depends on <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">A</span>.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Much has been philosophized about these short sentences, but the principle they describe is not difficult to understand. For the sake of illustration, here is first an example of the principle applied to something outside of Dependent Arising:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There will be rain, only if there are clouds. Rain happens because clouds form.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If there are no clouds, there won’t be rain. If the clouds disappear, the rain will stop.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Rain depends on clouds.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The point is simple: there can be no rain without clouds. In other words, rain <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">requires</span> clouds. Clouds are <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">needed for</span> rain. Rain <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">depends on</span> clouds. Or, for those familiar with logical terminology, clouds are <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">a necessary condition</span> for rain.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But the Buddha did not apply his investigation to rain, nor to any other phenomena in the outside world.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> He was interested in suffering, which is found inside of beings. So next is an example of the principle that stays within the context where it was meant to be applied, that of Dependent Arising:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There will be death, only if there is birth. Death happens because birth happened first.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If there is no birth, there won’t be death. If birth ceases, death will cease.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Death depends on birth.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Put simply: you will die because you were born; but if you don’t get reborn, you won’t die again.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This principle is called ‘dependency’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">idap-paccayatā</span>),<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> which explains the name ‘Dependent Arising’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paṭicca-samuppāda</span>). The words <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paccaya</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paṭicca</span> both come from the verb <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pacceti</span>, meaning ‘to fall back on, to depend on’. The principle has also been called ‘conditionality’, which loses the link between these two terms but means the same.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The principle of dependency applies not only to birth and death, but to all the links: death depends on birth, birth depends on the continuation of existence, and so on through the rest of the chain. So in the end all factors rely on ignorance. Imagine a tower of twelve bricks stacked on top of one another. If you remove the bottom brick, the whole stack will come crashing down. Why? Because the bricks supported one another, and they all relied on the bottom brick. Similarly, if you remove ignorance, all the other factors also will cease to be. Why? Because in the end they all depended on ignorance. If you end ignorance, you will therefore also end suffering. It takes some time for the tower to fall down, though. Suffering does not end immediately when ignorance ends, but only at the end of life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To illustrate:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-figure">
<p><img src="../seeds2025/media/image2.png" style="width:2.02362in;height:1.51969in" alt="40|border|A stack of twelve bricks.

The bottom brick is labeled ‘no ignorance’, the top one ‘no suffering’, and one in between ‘no rebirth’" ><br>
Figure 1. Dependent Arising as a tower of bricks</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Since this may all sound rather theoretical so far, I must emphasize that the principle of dependency is a means of reflection, not a mere philosophical theory. Whenever it is mentioned in the Pāli Canon, it always describes someone’s empirical insights or reflections. For example, in <a href="#bqseg49"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§49</span></a>: “You closely and properly focus on the dependent arising of things, reflecting: ‘There will be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">this</span>, only if there is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">that</span>. […] That is to say: Dependent on ignorance […]” The principle is meant to be applied to your personal experience to understand, among other things, how you yourself have been creating rebirth and may do so again in the future.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-centrality-of-rebirth'>The centrality of rebirth</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Many of the links in Dependent Arising are not only necessary conditions but also sufficient conditions.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> Sufficient conditions guarantee their outcome. For example, if there is birth, there will always be death as a consequence. Birth <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">guarantees</span> death. Therefore, birth is a sufficient condition for death (as well as a necessary one). But not all links are sufficient conditions. Just like a cloudy sky does not guarantee that it will rain, sensations don’t guarantee craving, for example. If they did, there would be no way to stop craving! So sensations are not a sufficient condition for craving. Likewise, craving and ignorance do not guarantee birth, because you may have those defilements today, but get enlightened tomorrow, whereafter you will not be reborn again. So your craving and ignorance were not sufficient conditions for birth. That said, this distinction between necessary and sufficient conditions can quickly become too technical, if it hasn’t already. It is not mentioned in the discourses either, so it may be better to not overthink it. The links that are sufficient conditions are quite clear anyway, once the meaning of the factors is explained.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>However, there is one link where sufficiency may not be evident, and it just so happens to be the most important one: that between birth and suffering. It means that once you are born and alive, suffering is inevitable. Only by not getting reborn again, can you end suffering. This insight forms one of the backbones of Dependent Arising. Rebirth therefore is the primary issue this teaching addresses. As the Buddha said to Ānanda:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§10</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching [of Dependent Arising] that this population […] does leave behind the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the nether world, and transmigration (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>).<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The focal point of Dependent Arising is also very clear in the next passage. Here the Buddha says he obtained his own insights into Dependent Arising after wondering how rebirth can be stopped. He investigated this matter using the principle of dependency in its various phrasings, starting at old age and death and working his way back to ignorance. Discourses like this are usually abbreviated, but to clarify how the principle of dependency applies to all links, I included it in full.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In this text ‘old age and death’ is used as a shorthand for all suffering. This is a common feature in the discourses, especially those on Dependent Arising. Old age and death are a shorthand for suffering not only because they are some of its more noticeable forms, but also because as long as there still is a possibility for old age and death—that is to say, as long as you are alive—there will still be suffering. To clarify, in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on Direct Conditions</span> it is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">suffering</span> which is said to be directly dependent on birth, not old age and death as in the standard sequence. It says: “And what is the direct condition for suffering? Birth, you should answer.”<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> This also reinforces what was mentioned before, that once a being is born, suffering is inevitable as long as they are alive.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-meaning-of-the-factors'>The meaning of the factors</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>While the principle of dependency and its application to the twelve factors are conveyed very clearly in the previous discourse, the actual meaning of the factors is not. The Buddha did not explain what ‘birth’ exactly refers to, for example. Most suttas on Dependent Arising similarly mention the standard sequence with little to no explanation of what the individual factors mean. I can think of two main reasons for this, and they are important to consider if we want to properly understand Dependent Arising.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>One, the bare twelvefold sequence is not meant to be a full explanation itself, but primarily serves as a mnemonic device (something easy to remember).<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> The audience would have heard more detailed explanations and definitions of the twelve factors in other discourses, which they would have had in the backs of their minds while listening to the more bare sequences of factors. We should do the same, not taking the factors in isolation but consider how they are used and defined elsewhere. If we were to focus on the twelve words and ignore the wider context, we could give these words—which moreover are in an ancient language that is not completely understood—almost any meaning we’d like.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Two, to people back then the individual links would have been more self-explanatory than they are to us. Many of the links may make immediate sense to us as well, such as that between birth and death and that between sensations and craving. But some links do not make sense right away, like that between consciousness and the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, especially when the latter (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>) is translated as ‘name and form’. The Buddha discovered a timeless principle, but the words he used to explain this principle are not timeless. They were spoken at a specific point in time, to a certain audience that had different ideas than us. This we should also take into account. If we interpret these historical texts too much from a contemporary perspective, we are bound to misunderstand things. In linguistic studies this is called <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">presentism</span>: “the anachronistic introduction of present-day ideas and perspectives into depictions or interpretations of the past”.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The language gap and cultural divide also mean someone could fully understand the general principle of Dependent Arising through direct insight, even be fully enlightened, but still not understand what words like <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> mean (or what any Pāli word means, for that matter). For this reason we should also be careful to stay objective about the texts and not interpret them too much in light of our own subjective ideas, even if we are very wise. If we do have deep insights, it does become a lot easier to interpret the words rightly, but it is still no guarantee. Unfortunately, insight into the Dhamma does not come with miraculous linguistic abilities!</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reader should also be aware that translations are by their nature always imperfect. As K.R. Norman, one of the greatest Pāli linguists, said: “It is very difficult to give a one for one translation of Sanskrit and Pāli words into English. It is very rare that one Sanskrit or Pāli word has exactly the same connotations, no less and no more, as one English word.”<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> This is even more true when dealing with topics as abstract as Dependent Arising. But leaving words in Pāli is no solution either, as Norman also continued to say, so I use English terms here, accepting their inevitable shortcomings. The meaning of these terms will have to be clarified by their explanations more so than by the translations themselves. This applies especially to ‘consciousness’, as we shall see.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With the above principles in mind, I arrived at an understanding of Dependent Arising that differs little from that of most traditional Buddhist schools.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> All will be explained in detail later, but to give a general overview: Unenlightened beings don’t know the true nature of life, not understanding suffering and its causes. Deluded by this absence of knowledge, or <span data-custom-style="Strong">ignorance</span>, they perform certain intentional acts, also known as karma. At death, driven along by craving, these <span data-custom-style="Strong">willful actions</span> direct the being’s <span data-custom-style="Strong">consciousness</span> into a next life—in part through guilt and rejoicing over past actions, in part through acts of the will arising around the time of death itself. The being’s actions influence where they take rebirth and thereby also shape <span data-custom-style="Strong">the individual’s immaterial aspects and body</span>, with the ‘immaterial aspects’ being general features of the being’s “inner world”. When beings are born, there are <span data-custom-style="Strong">the six senses</span>, the five physical ones plus the mind. When these senses are aware of things, there are <span data-custom-style="Strong">sense impressions</span>, which result in pleasant, painful, and neutral <span data-custom-style="Strong">sensations</span>. As long as there still is ignorance, <span data-custom-style="Strong">craving</span> arises to experience certain sensations and avoid others. Such cravings will continue at the time of death, when it becomes the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">fuel</span> for rebirth. Or, from a different perspective, out of craving beings <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">take up</span> the five aspects of existence again. This <span data-custom-style="Strong">fuel/taking up</span> causes a next <span data-custom-style="Strong">existence</span> after death and a resultant <span data-custom-style="Strong">birth</span> in a next life. Once the being is born, there is <span data-custom-style="Strong">suffering, including old age and death</span>. But when the being gets enlightened, ignorance and craving disappear, and the whole chain collapses. Then suffering will come to an end at death, when all experiences cease as the six senses disappear.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All this can happen because there is no solid essence in any part of existence, no self involved in any of the links. This absence of a self (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anatta</span>) is not explicitly mentioned in the standard sequences, but it is always implied. It is explained in many discourses on Dependent Arising, and is of utmost importance for a correct understanding of it. However, it is not the focus here, so I will discuss it only in passing, primarily in <a href="#chapter12"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Chapter 12</span></a> to explain why the cessation of existence (including consciousness) is not the annihilation of an essence.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To better illustrate the functions of the twelve factors, the table below displays them alongside the standard truth on the origin of suffering, the craving that leads to a next life. (‘Next life’ translates <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">puna-bhava</span>, more literally ‘re-existence’.) Since words are fluid but tables are not, this overview may box in some of the factors a bit too strictly. For example, the factor of existence is not just part of the rebirth process, it also continues after birth. The same applies to consciousness and the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. But the table can serve as a useful general overview, as will similar tables that are to follow.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The sequence from craving down to suffering I call the ‘craving sequence’ and all preceding factors the ‘ignorance sequence’. These two sequences function side by side in the creation of a next life. Both contain factors pertaining to rebirth, which means the twelvefold sequence describes the process of rebirth twice, illustrating the same process from two different angles. This is useful, because it lets us reflect upon the origin and cessation of suffering in multiple ways. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Visuddhimagga</span> says the two are different ways of teaching which are suitable for different people.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> To generalize, we might say the ignorance sequence focuses on the ethical and cognitive aspects, the craving sequence on the emotional and existential ones.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The double inclusion of the process of birth in the full sequence fits the Buddha’s inquiry in <a href="#bqseg11"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§11</span></a>: “They are <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">born</span>, age, die, pass on, and are <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">reborn</span> again.” It also emphasizes that every birth is a <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">re</span>birth. It is often assumed that in the Buddha’s India everybody believed in rebirth, but the discourses regularly mention the materialistic view of a single lifetime. This could have prompted the Buddha to describe the process of birth twice in the sequence, clarifying that it is about rebirth.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Possible-development-of-the-twelvefold-sequence'>Possible development of the twelvefold sequence</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Later chapters will repeatedly show that there are indeed two parallel descriptions of rebirth in the twelvefold sequence, but the link between sensations and craving already hints that at this place two shorter sequences may have been joined together. Take the statement, “if sensations cease, craving will cease”. While this may theoretically be true, the actual way to end craving is not through ending sensations. Craving can only be ended through wisdom, through removing ignorance. The link between sensations and craving therefore seems a little artificial, possibly inserted to connect the two shorter sequences into the twelvefold one.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Based on various other grounds, many scholars have come to similar conclusions.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> Tilmann Vetter for example concluded: “Two different chains of dependent origination of suffering were superficially combined into the twelvefold chain. The first part (links 1–7) [the ignorance sequence] is a more developed attempt at explaining the origin of suffering than the second part.”<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Franz Bernhard likewise thought: “It is noticeable that factors 8–12 [the craving sequence] are just a further elaboration of the basic idea of the four noble truths. […] Originally the Buddha identified only thirst [i.e. craving] as the cause of rebirth […] later—apparently influenced by and in controversy with competing contemporary systems—came then the rationale for rebirth through <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">avidyā</span>, ignorance.”<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Text-critical evidence for such a possible development comes from three Chinese parallels to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> They all start with the craving sequence beginning at old age and death, later mention a sequence going from craving down to consciousness, but never combine the two into the longer ninefold sequence found in the Pāli version, which goes straight from old age and death down to consciousness. See the table below, where for sake of comprehensiveness I also added the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Dīrgha Āgama</span> parallel to the same sutta, which contains all twelve factors.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>As another indication for the combination of the two parallel sequences, one Pāli discourse joins the craving sequence in its cessation mode to part of the ignorance sequence in its origination mode. In this discourse the cessation of craving does not depend on the cessation of feeling, as in the default sequence.</p>

<p>And what is the cessation of suffering? A sight-consciousness arises dependent on the sense of sight and sights. The combination of the three is a sense impression. Dependent on sense impressions, there are sensations. Dependent on sensations, there is craving. But if craving completely fades away and ceases, fuel/taking up will cease. If fuel/taking up ceases, existence will cease. If existence ceases, birth will cease. And if birth ceases, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress, will cease. That is how this whole mass of suffering ceases. That is the cessation of suffering.

<p>Discourses such as this may have been precursors to the standard twelvefold sequence. I do not wish to discuss the possible development of this sequence further here, however, as such analysis quickly becomes overly speculative. My point is simply that it is one piece of evidence for seeing two parallel descriptions of rebirth in the twelvefold sequence. And to clarify, unlike some scholars I do not mean to suggest the twelvefold sequence, or any other version of Dependent Arising in the Pāli Canon, was devised by someone other than the Buddha.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

We already encountered an example of this at <a href="#bqseg6"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§6</span></a> and will see some others later.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> Such explanations are possible because the craving sequence by itself already forms a complete teaching on the origin of suffering, just like Sāriputta’s short explanation of Dependent Arising in <a href="#bqseg5"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§5</span></a>, and just like the standard truth on the origin of suffering itself. We can therefore also contemplate the fundamental principles of Dependent Arising by considering only the five “bricks” of the craving sequence, as in the following illustration. This can be pragmatically relevant, since the ignorance sequence contains some terms which can be hard to relate to (particularly <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>) while the craving sequence may be more readily understood.</p>

<p>The hand that pulls out the brick of craving I labeled ‘wisdom’ to emphasize craving cannot be removed by an act of will or by simply being mindful. It requires deep insights into the nature of life. Craving itself depends on ignorance, on not seeing reality as it is. We will always desire existence as long as we think there is some sort of real happiness to be found in it, as long as we don’t understand what suffering is. That is why the Buddha said:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Mendicants, I mentioned you can find no beginning to the craving for existence, such that before that, there was no craving for existence, and after that, it came into being. However, the craving for existence is still seen to be dependent on something. I tell you the craving for existence has its nutriment, it is not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the craving for existence? Ignorance, you should answer.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></p>

<p>Here unknowing (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">aññāṇa</span>), i.e. ignorance, is said to be the root of yearning, i.e. craving.

We may be able to temporarily stop our desires, but as long as the root of ignorance still exists, the weed of craving will keep coming up.</p>

<p>Since craving depends on ignorance, yet another way to depict Dependent Arising as a tower of bricks is with a stick between ignorance and craving, as illustrated next. It is another way to think about the two parallel sequences.</p>

Figure 6. The two sequences as connected stacks of bricks</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I fear this illustration may be confusing, so let me explain. As long as ignorance stays in place, there will be craving; as long as there is ignorance and craving, there will be rebirth; and as long as there is rebirth, there will be suffering. The only way to end the problem is by removing ignorance, because it is the only brick with a string to pull. If you remove ignorance, then craving will cease, and as a result rebirth and suffering will too.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Please know that the illustration is limited by nature, and also do not think of it as a causal sequence working up from the bottom. There are not two separate rebirths, for example, even though the word ‘rebirth’ is included twice. The two bricks labeled as such are in reality not different rebirth processes. In a sense we might even say they are part of the same brick. The same applies to the two bricks labeled ‘suffering’, and to ignorance and craving, which may be seen as the combined root for rebirth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With that in mind, let me give one last tower analogy. We can also think of the twelve factors of Dependent Arising like this:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-figure">

From top to bottom, they are labeled on the left as ‘suffering’, ‘birth’, ‘existence’, ‘taking up’, and ‘craving’; and from the right as ‘sensations/impressions’, ‘six senses/imm. &amp; body’, ‘consciousness’, ‘willful actions’, and ‘ignorance’." > <img src="../seeds2025/media/image11.png" style="width:2.01969in;height:1.51575in" alt="40|border|A stack of five bricks toppling over.

Figure 7. The two parallel sequences as one stack of bricks</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To briefly clarify, craving and ignorance are the fundamental problems. Together they underlie the more active defilements of willful actions and taking up. At death, the will causes the (re)taking up of the five aggregates, which leads to the continuation of consciousness into a next existence. This results in a birth in the respective realm, producing the immaterial aspects and body along with the six senses. Having six senses, there will be old age and death and all other suffering: all the sensations that come from sense impressions.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> That is how the two parallel sequences function together to create suffering.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But if there is no ignorance, there will be no craving either. Lacking them, there are also no (defiled) willful actions, which include taking up. Without the propulsive power of those, there will not be another existence and no consciousness continuing after death. Then there is no next birth, and therefore also no immaterial aspects &amp; body, and no six senses. Having no six senses, there are no sense impressions, no sensations, and therefore no suffering. And, as the Buddha would say, that is how this whole mass of suffering ceases.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-space">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The idea of there being two parallel descriptions of rebirth in the twelvefold sequence, which is also the fundamental interpretation of the Pāli commentaries, is in modern times often called the ‘three-lifetime model’. But this term is confusing and possibly ill-informed, because as explained, the factors can also span just two lives, with ignorance and craving working together in the creation of a single rebirth. To explain the general principles the commentaries give a specific <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">example</span> of how the factors can span three lives, but the model is not limited to this, as the commentaries themselves also make very clear. Bhikkhu Bodhi explains: “The [commentarial] distribution into three lives is only an expository device which, for the sake of concision, has to resort to abstraction and oversimplification.”<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> None of the factors are limited to one particular life either. For instance, unenlightened beings were ignorant in the past life and still are in the current one, and as a consequence they suffer in the current life and will continue to do so in the next. It does not mean that ignorance only existed in the past life and suffering only in the future one. One would think this goes without saying, but it is a perennial misunderstanding of the model.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Putting-this-book-in-perspective'>Putting this book in perspective</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I hope the tower-of-bricks analogy in its various forms made the abstract idea of dependency a bit more tangible. However, it has its limits, like all analogies, and it does oversimplify some things. Most significantly, it paints a very static picture which fails to convey that rebirth is an active process. It does not properly depict the propulsive forces behind rebirth, the tendencies of the mind to move on to a next life, which are present primarily in the factors of willful actions and taking up. To offset this, Chapter 10 is dedicated to these factors. For now, with a preliminary understanding of Dependent Arising, we can turn to our main sutta, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>, and start investigating the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But before we do, I want to pause for one more moment to provide some perspective, because we will dive in the deep end and rarely get back to the shallows. We will discuss some of the factors in Dependent Arising that are most enigmatic, primarily those of willful actions, consciousness, and the immaterial aspects and body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>). It will take us into technical details, obscure texts, linguistic aspects of Pāli, and some hotly debated passages, all of which might make it seem like those who do not study a lot, have no chance of understanding Dependent Arising. But this is far from the truth. Real insights will come from meditation, not from study. The technical observations made here are not necessary to arrive at these insights.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Still, the Buddha taught Dependent Arising for good reasons. As long as we are able to appreciate some of the cultural and textual complications, there are some important lessons to be learned from every link in the chain. The following chapters will hopefully help unravel some of these complications and thereby shed some light not only on the Buddha’s teachings but also on the nature of life itself.</p>

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-meaning-of-‘birth’,-‘old-age’,-and-‘death’'>The meaning of ‘birth’, ‘old age’, and ‘death’</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As explained in the previous chapter, the twelve factors of Dependent Arising should not be read in a vacuum. They have to be interpreted in a larger context, otherwise it is all too easy to misunderstand what they are about. It would be like visiting only the final lecture of a university course, when the professor summarizes all that he taught that semester, using terms that were defined in earlier lectures.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To give a concrete example, the factors of ‘birth’, ‘old age’, and ‘death’ are sometimes interpreted to refer to the constant arising and passing away of certain mind states or of a sense of self.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> But that the Buddha did not have this in mind quickly becomes apparent once his definitions of these terms are considered. These definitions occur at least seven times in the Nikāyas, including in texts with such names as <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">The Analysis of the Truths</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">The Discourse on Right View</span>.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta,</span> the connected discourses on Dependent Arising, they occur four times:</p>

<p>§20</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg20" class="anchor"></span>And what is old age and death? The old age of all kinds of beings in any order of beings—them being old, having broken teeth, gray hair, wrinkled skin, decreased vitality, and failing faculties: that is what’s called old age. The passing on of all kinds of beings from any order of beings—their passing away, deceasing, dying, death, demise, the end of their life, their aspects of existence breaking up, them laying down the body: that is what’s called death. The two taken together, that is what’s called old age and death.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It should be needless to say that states of mind don’t have broken teeth or gray hair, and are not the laying down of the body.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another important text to consider is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, the Great Discourse on the Sources [of Things],<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> which is the most detailed discourse on Dependent Arising in the Pāli Canon. It explains the connection between birth and death as follows:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§21</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Ānanda, I said old age and death depend on birth, which is to be understood as follows: If there were completely and utterly no birth at all, not of anyone anywhere—not of gods into the state of gods, not of celestials, not of spirits, not of ghosts, not of human beings, not of quadrupeds, not of birds, not of creepy-crawlies into the state of creepy-crawlies—not of any beings into any state. Then, with the total absence and cessation of birth, would old age and death occur?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“No, sir.”<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another relevant discourse is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahāpadāna Sutta</span>, where the Buddha tells the story of the bodhisattva Vipassī leaving his palace in a chariot. (This story in later centuries got mistaken to be about Gotama’s own life.)<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a> On his travels, Vipassī met an old person, a sick person, and a dead person. On coming back to his palace he said: “Curse this thing called birth! For old age, sickness, and death will come to those who are born.” He soon thereafter wondered, just like Gotama in <a href="#bqseg11"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§11</span></a>: “People have really gotten into trouble. They are born, age, die, pass on, and are reborn again. Yet they don’t see any escape from this suffering, this old age and death and so on. When will an escape from all this finally be found?”<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> This question resulted in Vipassī’s insights into Dependent Arising, which also shows that birth, old age, and death are not states of mind or other momentary processes.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But this might have been less clear if we only considered the words themselves and not the way they are used. It’s an example of using context to determine the meaning of words. Instead of focusing on single words, we should look at the canon as a whole. Unfortunately, things are not as obvious with the factors of ‘willful actions’, ‘consciousness’, and ‘the individual’s immaterial aspects and body’, but this makes it even more important to consider as many relevant contexts as possible. Although these factors are not as clearly defined, their role in Dependent Arising is clarified in many discourses, including the one we’re primarily concerned with, the If There is Desire Discourse, which I will introduce after a note on the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-meaning-of-bhava'>The meaning of bhava</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Earlier I said my interpretation of Dependent Arising differs a little from tradition. For all intents and purposes this is only true for the factor of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>, which I translate dependent on context as ‘existence’ or ‘state of existence’. It basically means a life in a certain place, the continuance of existence after death in a certain realm. The Pāli commentaries include in this factor both rebirth into a next existence and the karma leading to that next existence, although they do so inconsistently.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> I do not think the inclusion of karma has any basis in the early texts and agree with Eviatar Shulman: “<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Bhava</span> probably [just] means a state of existence, a rebirth as a creature in any one of the different realms. Such a reading of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> has been suggested by numerous scholars.”<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> One of these scholars, Lambert Schmithausen, more directly stated that the interpretation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> as karma is alien to the early discourses and from their perspective can safely be disregarded.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> Venerable Bodhi also notes at the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bhava Sutta</span>: “What is meant [by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>] is a concrete state of individual existence in one of the three realms”,<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a> which are the sensual, form, and formless realms. This is in accordance with how <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> is defined in context of Dependent Arising.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This interpretation also finds ancient support. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Arthaviniścaya Sūtra</span> is a Sanskrit early text which in its section on Dependent Arising first explains the factor of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> as occurring in three realms, just like the Pāli discourses, but then subdivides these realms further. Under the sensual realm it mentions animals, human beings, and lower gods, among others beings; under the form realm it mentions the gods of the Brahmā realm and higher; and under the formless realm it mentions the gods that spend their whole life span in one of the four formless states.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Madhyama Āgama</span> parallel to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> likewise explains the link between existence (有) and birth by saying that there is existence of fish in the state of fish, birds in that of birds, and so forth.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> The idea appears to be that the being first has to come to a certain realm before being physically born there. A curious but illuminating sutta in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span> confirms this when stating that certain highly developed non-returners will still obtain existence but not birth.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> They are said to attain full extinguishment (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>) “in between”, which means in a state of existence after death but before taking a proper rebirth.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Venerable Nāgārjuna, who held the same general interpretation of Dependent Arising as this book, wrote in the second century that for the liberated one there will be no further existence and that “existence (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>) is the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>”.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> Nāgārjuna’s view is well-supported by the Pāli Canon.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is also said that a being after death gets reborn in a certain state of existence (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava-upapatti</span>).<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Ratana Sutta</span> states the stream enterer won’t have an eighth <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>, meaning an eighth life.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a> At least one discourse further says that all <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> only ends at the death of an enlightened being,<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a> which also disproves the common idea that it means some momentary “becoming” that ends at enlightenment.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discourses in many other ways indicates that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span> means existence, not karma or becoming,<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a> but since this difference in interpretation is not of too much concern for the current discussion on consciousness, I will leave it at this.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Even though this discourse serves as an explanation of Dependent Arising, it is by no means the clearest text on the topic. It can be puzzling at first, so the remainder of this book will explain it in detail, finishing with my interpretation of the simile of the light beam.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To start, like most if not all suttas on Dependent Arising, the If There is Desire Discourse primarily concerns rebirth. That is why the Buddha said the four nutriments support those to be reborn.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a> These four nutriments also maintain beings who are already born, which is most obvious in the case of the nutriment of edible food. Stop eating, and you’ll die. This is even the case for enlightened beings. However, as its title suggests, the If There is Desire Discourse is not about eating food, but about <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">desiring</span> food, and this desire is what will lead to being reborn.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If at death there still is desire for the four nutriments, the discourse says, it results in rebirth. To abbreviate: “If there is desire, enjoyment, and craving […], existence in a future life is produced.” This is just a rephrasing of second truth of the noble one, which says the origin of suffering is “the craving that leads to a next life, which, along with enjoyment and desire, looks for happiness in various realms”. Notice the identical terms ‘craving’, ‘enjoyment’, and ‘desire’. Also found in both statements is the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">punabbhava</span>, which I normally translate as ‘next life’, but the expression <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ayatiṁ punabbhava</span> I translate as ‘existence in a future life’. This expression is elsewhere equated to “lying in a womb in the future”.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Sāriputta once rephrased the second truth as follows. Notice here the reappearance of ‘existence in a future life’ and ‘look for happiness in various realms’.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To clarify the connections between these three texts, the statement by Sāriputta has the following factors:</p>

<p>These three texts convey the exact same ideas, just in various levels of details. Some of the terminology may be a bit elusive at first—I’m referring specifically to the planting of consciousness and the conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body—but in essence they all say that craving and other defilements lead to rebirth.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This table not only further clarifies that the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> is about rebirth, it also is an indication that the craving and ignorance sequences indeed function in parallel, as was presumed when they were first introduced. The discourse takes an alternative route through the standard factors, namely: craving (8) › consciousness (3) › the individual’s immaterial aspects and body (4) › existence (10) › birth (11) › suffering (12).<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a> It therefore shifts from the craving sequence to the ignorance sequence and back, showing that these two sequences are different ways to describe the same process. (The development of willful actions in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> is not equal to the willful actions of the ignorance sequence, though. It is the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">development</span>, the outcome, of willful actions, not the actions themselves. I’ll return to this.)</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Conception'>Conception</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>That the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> is about rebirth can also be derived from the sentence, “where consciousness is planted and sprouts, there is a conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body”. Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi rightly concluded that this means “the arrival of the current of consciousness from the past existence into the new one [resulting in] the arising of a new psychophysical organism at conception”.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a> Here ‘conception’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">avakkanti</span>) means the kind that happens at a pregnancy. The word is also used in the definition of ‘birth’ (<a href="#bqseg20"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§20</span></a>) and in the largest discourse on Dependent Arising in the Pāli Canon, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, which mentions the conception of consciousness together with the immaterial aspects and body <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">in the mother’s womb</span> (<a href="#bqseg84"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§84</span></a>). In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sampasādanīya Sutta</span> the Buddha also mentions conception in the mother’s womb, as does Raṭṭhapāla in the Therāgāthā. The nun Isidāsī likewise describes having been conceived in the wombs of various animals.<a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a> ‘Conception’ clearly refers to the process of birth here.<a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another reference to pregnancy in context of Dependent Arising occurs in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">

[And so on.]<a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">avakkanti</span> is also clarified by the Pāli Canon’s second-largest text on Dependent Arising, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving</span>, which also mentions the conception of a fetus. It describes the birth of a child who, if he remains attached to sensations, will be reborn again. So there are two subsequent births in this passage, just like in the default sequence of Dependent Arising.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§26</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg26" class="anchor"></span>Mendicants, a fetus is conceived (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">avakkanti</span>) when there is a combination of three things. No fetus is conceived when the mother is not in her fertile period, even though there is coitus of the mother and father, and a spirit to be reborn is awaiting. Nor is a fetus conceived when no spirit to be reborn is awaiting, even though the mother is in her fertile period, and there is coitus of the mother and father. But when there is coitus of the mother and father, the mother is in her fertile period, and a spirit to be reborn is awaiting, a fetus is conceived.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The mother then carries the fetus inside her womb for nine or ten months: a heavy burden, causing much anxiety. After those nine or ten months she gives birth: another heavy burden, causing much anxiety. When the infant is born she nourishes it with her own blood, for mother’s milk is called ‘blood’ in the training of the Noble One.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The boy grows up and his faculties mature. He plays children’s games such as somersaults, tipcat, pinwheels, toy ploughs, toy weights, toy carts, and toy bows. The boy grows up further and his faculties mature further. He amuses himself, being well supplied and provided with the objects of the five senses: sights cognized with the sense of sight, sounds cognized with the sense of hearing, smells cognized with the sense of smell, flavors cognized with the sense of taste, and tangibles cognized with the sense of touch, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, sensual, and alluring.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When he sees sights with the sense of sight, he gets attracted to pleasing ones and becomes averse to displeasing ones. He does not practice recollection of the body. He has a restricted mind, and does not accurately understand where those bad, unwholesome qualities completely cease: the liberation of the mind and liberation through understanding. Favoring and opposing in that way, whatever sensations he feels—whether pleasant, painful, or neutral—he enjoys, welcomes, and keeps holding on to them. It results in enjoyment, and when there is enjoyment of sensations, there is fuel/taking up. Dependent on fuel/taking up, existence. Dependent on existence, birth. And dependent on birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates. [Similar for the sense of hearing, the sense of smell, the sense of taste, the sense of touch, and the mind.]<a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a></p>

<p>Although in this specific passage we do not encounter ‘the individual’s immaterial aspects and body’, just prior the discourse includes it in the standard sequence of Dependent Arising.

<p>As a sidenote, ‘spirit to be reborn’ translates <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span>.

The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Ekottarika Āgama</span> parallel uses ‘external consciousness’ (外識),<a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a> which must refer to the being’s consciousness that has not yet entered the womb, similar to the description of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> (<a href="#bqseg84"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§84</span></a>). This is what in part makes Venerable Anālayo “allow for an identification of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span> with the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>” of Dependent Arising.<a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a> In a similar context in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Assalāyana Sutta</span>, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span> is said to be either a ruler, brahmin, merchant, or worker.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Madhyama Āgama</span> parallel clarifies that this refers to their past life and refers to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span> as “the one to be born”.<a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a> After an analysis of the term in both Buddhist and Vedic contexts, Wijesekera also concluded: “The term was deliberately employed by early Buddhism, perhaps for the first time in the religious history of India, to denote the ‘surviving factor’ in man.”<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a> The reason for the debate is that this conclusion has little connection with how the term is used in the rest of the canon, where it usually refers to a type of mythological heavenly being. I translate <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span> here in line with the Pāli commentaries and Āgamas, as ‘spirit to be reborn’. (In accepting <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">this</span> interpretation, however, I would add that it seems reasonable the spirit can also arrive a considerable time <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">after</span> the intercourse of the parents, or put differently, that ‘conception of the fetus’ does not refer to the biological fertilization of the egg but to a later point during gestation, namely the moment the spirit enters the womb.)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Regardless of what <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">gandhabba</span> exactly means in this passage, its presence results in the conception of the fetus, which is followed by the arising of the sense faculties. Earlier the discourse also said, in line with the standard sequence of Dependent Arising, that the six senses are generated and brought about by the individual’s immaterial aspects and body.<a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106" role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a> So in the same text we have <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">fetus › six senses</span>, and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">immaterial aspects and body › six senses</span>. It is therefore logical to relate the immaterial aspects and body to the fetus also here, just as in <a href="#bqseg25"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§25</span></a>, which said, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">fetus = immaterial aspects and body › the six senses</span>. In these instances, ‘fetus’ and ‘immaterial aspects and body’ are practically synonymous, both leading to the six senses.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The development of the fetus into the boy whose “faculties mature” can be seen as more or less equivalent to the immaterial aspects and body leading to the six senses in the standard sequence. As Vetter observed: “The six sense organs cannot start to function fully before the moment of birth. They may be seen as the result of the growth of a person (‘name and form’) in the mother’s womb.”<a href="#fn107" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107" role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The connection between the immaterial aspects &amp; body and the six senses is also clarified by the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, which skips the six senses in its list of factors and has sense impressions depend directly on the immaterial aspects and body; see <a href="#table6"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">table 6</span></a>. The six senses, which, as Vetter said, are the sense “organs”, cannot reasonably be included under sense impressions. If we assume the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> describes the same basic principles as the default sequence—and there is no reason not to—they must therefore be included under <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.<a href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108" role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a> This indicates that both the six senses and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> are part of the same thing, namely the being.

<p>To summarize this section, the conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body in the If There is Desire Discourse is the same type of conception described in the other passages included in the above, which is that of a being.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As a final observation, although both the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> and the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving</span> specifically talk about human conception, this does not mean that the conception of the immaterial aspects and body always takes place in the human realm. Conception also happens for other beings, and also outside of wombs. Still, the Buddha’s teachings on Dependent Arising do tend to focus on human existence. The reason seems straightforward: most of his listeners were humans, who could relate to human birth more readily.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>You too are a human, and when reflecting on rebirth it may even be helpful to wonder how you arrived in this particular life, how you ended up in your mother’s womb. This is what the Buddha encourages his followers to do when he describes the psychic power of past life recollection: “You remember passing away from [the last life], and being reborn <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">here</span>.”<a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110" role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a> Most of your current attachments are likely also in the human realm, encouraging future rebirth in a womb again. The child in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving</span> is not just any child: it represents the listener. Do you want to go through that process again? Being “a heavy burden, causing much anxiety” for yet another mother? Reflecting like this, these passages on fetuses and wombs, which at the surface might seem unpragmatic, start to become relevant.</p>

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Historical-context-of-“name-and-form”'>Historical context of “name and form”</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I have already deviated from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> quite a bit, intending to show that the conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>) refers to rebirth. Before returning to this discourse, in the remainder of this chapter I will further clarify this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. Erich Frauwallner found the interpretation of this term “offers no difficulties”,<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111" role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a> but I disagree, even though we arrived at similar conclusions. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nāmarūpa</span> is not an easy concept, because a rich cultural history lies behind it. It can be very unintuitive to us, especially when translated literally as ‘name and form’. It misses some of the ancient implications, but I prefer a more pragmatic and self-explanatory translation, ‘the individual’s immaterial aspects and body’, in part because in the Buddha’s time the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> would have been quite self-explanatory too. The Buddha had profound insights but always used everyday language to convey them.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was not invented by the Buddha. It also occurs in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>, and has precursors in the earlier Vedas. That does not necessarily make the term specific to the Brahmins, however. “It seems safe enough to assume that <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣadic</span> terminology represents more or less the prevalent verbal conventions of the age contemporary with and immediately prior to the time of the historical Buddha, and that the Buddha did not deviate from these conventions without a compelling cause”, thought Reat.<a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a> In other words, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> already had certain connotations to the Buddha’s contemporaries. He simply adopted this term from society—although not without some philosophical differences, as we’ll see.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>We no longer have the same connotations with “name and form”, which is why some clarification is required. Grammatically <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is a compound consisting of two words: <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>. It likely originated as a possessive adjective rather than noun, as Liudmila Olalde suggests in the excellent <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Zum Begriff ‘nāmarūpa’: das Individuum im Pāli-Kanon</span> (<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">On the concept ‘nāmarūpa’: the individual in the Pāli Canon</span>).<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113" role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a> That is to say, the word meant ‘<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">with</span> a name and form’ rather than ‘<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">the</span> name and form’. In Pāli it is common for such adjectives to be used as nouns also. This is like the English adjective ‘wise’ being used as a noun in ‘the wise’, meaning people with wisdom. Likewise, the compound <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to an individual being <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">with</span> a certain name (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>) and form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>).</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As to the component of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>, in the suttas in general the word has a variety of meanings. It includes all sorts of appearances, such as colors, shapes, and dimensions, including those perceived with the mind, but it also encompasses the things which are perceived <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">through</span> their appearances.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a> For example, both the appearance of a fire and the fire itself were considered <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>. By extent <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> also included the four elements which were believed to be the substratum out of which all appearances and material manifest.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a> This does not align with modern ideas, which makes <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> not only hard for us to grasp but also impossible to translate accurately. Most translators stick to ‘form’ regardless of context, which in some instances may be too specific and in others too general. Remember earlier, when K.R. Norman said it is impossible to give a one on one translation for Pāli terms? <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Rūpa</span> is a good example of this.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the compound <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> as it is ordinarily used, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> refers specifically to the physical form of the being, which is why I translate it as ‘body’ in this context. The word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> has this meaning in other places too. One discourse says, “the form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>) of mortals gets old”, and another says, “with reference to this body: this form is seen to be discarded [at death]”.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a> Yet another says the space enclosed by flesh and skin is called ‘form’.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a> Although <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> far from always refers to the body, it does mean the body in some instances, and one of these instances is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span> also mention “my name (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>) and my body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-sanskrit">śarīra</span>)”, where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> seems to be replaced with <span data-custom-style="wwc-sanskrit">śarīra</span>, a more literal term for body.<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nāma</span>, which literally means ‘name’, will require a longer explanation. As part of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> the Pāli discourses define it as “sensation, perception, intention, sense impression, and attention”,<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a> which are subjective, immaterial parts of an individual’s experience, hence my translation ‘immaterial aspects’.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a> But this definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> may, and perhaps <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">should</span>, strike us as odd. Why would such parts of the being be called ‘name’?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">To answer this question</span> we have to take a detour from the Pāli Canon into the texts of the Brahmins. In those texts the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was used to refer to individual beings, who all had their own specific names and forms (or ‘visible appearances’, per <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame-zot-reference">Olivelle</span>). Their names and forms made beings distinguishable from others. In the Rig Veda, cows are said to differ from all other types of animals in appearance and also in name (‘cow’ instead of ‘horse’, say) but individual species of frogs can only be distinguished from one another by their appearance, not by name since they are all called ‘frog’.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</span> also shows that the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was used in ordinary speech to refer to individual beings. It describes how gods, humans, and other beings were created at the start of time, and then says:<a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122" role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Name-as-one’s-essence'>Name as one’s essence</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There is a more complex layer to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>, however, because there existed in society also a belief that the being’s name was an intrinsic part of that being. It was considered just as much a piece of them as their body, if not even more essential. The Buddha adopted the conventional term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> as a reference to individual beings, but not the belief that the name was part of the individual. His “definition” of ‘name’ as sensations, perceptions, and so forth, therefore was in all likelihood a skillful reinterpretation intended to challenge such beliefs, formed only after he already adopted the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> conventionally.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Let me clarify what sort of ideas the Buddha was replying to. In the thought-world of the time the name was generally considered an intrinsic part of the one who carried it. “A personal name is not different from the name bearer, on the contrary, it is an essential part of it”, found Olalde after an analysis of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in Brahmanic texts.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a> This notion was described more extensively by Jan Gonda:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Among students of comparative religion and cultural anthropology it is a matter of common knowledge that the name was widely regarded as an essential part of its bearer, as in a way identical with him; that it is “equivalent to his true existence” [quoting Eliade] or “is to be regarded as an essential part of his personality” [quoting Masani]. […] This belief obtained also in ancient India. Over and over again authors give evidence of their conviction that the connections between a name and its bearer, whether this is a person or a thing, is so intimate that there is for all practical purposes question of identity. […] Names are as essential a part of man’s personality as his physical strength, his organs, his life-breath.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127" role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The name “designates the whole character structure of man, perhaps because in ancient and archaic thought the name of a person magically incorporated its bearer’s personality”.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a> It was also believed to survive death, and to travel with the person to the afterlife. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</span>, the brahmin sage <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Yājñavalkya</span> is asked what doesn’t leave a person when he dies, and he answers, “his name”.<a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Such ideas about names are not unique to ancient India, nor are they merely theories of ancient texts. Anthropologist James George Frazer wrote in 1890:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Primitive man regards his name as a vital portion of himself and takes care of it accordingly. Thus, for example, the North American Indian regards his name, not as a mere label, but as a distinct part of his personality, just as much as are his eyes or his teeth, and believes that injury will result as surely from the malicious handling of his name as from a wound inflicted on any part of his physical organism. […] A Brahmin child receives two names, one for common use, the other a secret name which none but his father and mother should know. The latter is only used at ceremonies such as marriage. The custom is intended to protect the person against magic, since a charm only becomes effectual in combination with the real name.<a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130" role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>We can assume that many of these ideas were not unique to the Brahmins either. The belief that one’s name was an intrinsic part of one’s being likely prevailed throughout the Buddha’s India.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But for Brahmins the implications of names went further still. A Brahmin child was not fully recognized until given their (secret) name. Without a name they did not really exist as a person, because it was their name and form that separated beings from the shapeless, nameless universe, so Brahmins believed.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The naming of a child brings us back to conception and birth. Joanna Jurewicz wrote about a Brahmanic birth ritual “in the course of which the father accepted his son and gave him a name. By accepting his son, he confirmed his own identity with him; by giving him a name he took him out of the unnamed, unshaped chaos and finally created him.”<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131" role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a> The ritual, which was done to get a boy, started at the moment of intercourse. At this point in the process the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</span> contains a verse which is particularly interesting for our discussion, since it speaks of a fetus and forms in the mother’s womb. The father-to-be needed to recite this verse to his wife during intercourse in order to invoke the gods:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§28</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>May Viṣṇu prepare your womb,<br>
and Tvaṣṭṛ mold the forms;<br>
May Prajāpati impregnate you,<br>
and Dhātṛ lay the fetus in you.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132" role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The text continues. After ten lunar months the baby boy is born. Before he is allowed to drink his mother’s milk, the father has to give him a name, apparently whispering it into his ear to keep it secret. At this point the child was deemed truly “created”.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>So the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span> also contain a process of conception and birth, using the terms ‘womb’, ‘fetus’, ‘name’, and ‘form’—with the Sanskrit words all being equivalent to the Pāli: <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">yoni</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">garbha</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>, and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> respectively. There is a clear linguistic connection with Dependent Arising here, however distant, especially when we consider the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>’s passage on the conception of “name and form” in the mother’s womb. (<a href="#bqseg84"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§84</span></a>) Jurewicz believes the connection could explain the Buddha’s choice of “the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> to denote an organism in which <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vijñāna</span> [consciousness] settles”,<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133" role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a> although we should not assume he did so based on this Brahmanic ritual alone. The Buddha surely did not believe in the efficacy of the Brahmanic birth ritual, nor did he adopt the philosophy of one’s name being a part of one’s being. But he did use <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> in a similar fashion as the Brahmins. These words seem to have been a common way to refer to an individual.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-Buddha’s-definition-of-nāma'>The Buddha’s definition of nāma</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The belief that one’s name was an essential part of one’s being may have prompted the Buddha’s definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>, which he defined as sensation, perception, intention, sense impression, and attention. Initially he used the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> as it was used in common speech: to refer to the individual. The specific definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> was likely formed later. As Frauwallner observed: “The name, according to a very old idea, is a separate entity […] With the gradual development of the term ‘form’ […] the meaning of the idea ‘name’ also shifted. Thereunder were [by the Buddha] understood in contrast to corporeality the psychical factors [of sensation, perception, etc.]”<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134" role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Their name is something beings tend to identify with. It is something that “provides an abstract identity for the individual”,<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135" role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a> something beings tend take to be ‘them’. But this type of identification is contrary to the Buddha’s view of reality. “The fact that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> could easily have been identified with the core of a person or with a component subsisting after death may explain why its reinterpretation became necessary”, concluded also Olalde.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136" role="doc-noteref"><sup>136</sup></a> The Buddha’s definition (or, rather, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">reinterpretation</span>) of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> was not meant as an exact classification of certain parts of the being, nor was it intended to pinpoint what ‘name’ exactly is. It was a way to tell people that their names were just impersonal things, a way to teach <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anatta</span>, the absence of self. Instead of telling them what ‘name’ <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">is</span>, the Buddha basically said, “this is how this thing we call ‘name’ should be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">looked at</span>” (that is, not as a self-like entity, but as made of sensation, perception, and so forth). The Buddha was a pragmatist. Rather than giving a textbook-style definition, he taught something people could use for contemplation.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But why did he use these specific five factors: sensation, perception, intention, sense impression, and attention? Contemporary interpreters have presented their thoughts on this as if they are canonical, but no early discourse actually gives an explanation. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Visuddhimagga</span>’s interpretation of ‘bending (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">namana</span>) towards things’ is based on a playful but false etymology of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and cannot be taken seriously.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137" role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Śāriputra Abhidharma</span> suggests that the factors take part in the mental process of naming things.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138" role="doc-noteref"><sup>138</sup></a> We might go along with this suggestion, as long as we keep in mind that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> does not mean ‘nam<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">ing</span>’ but ‘name’, particularly one’s proper name, like the one given at birth.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139" role="doc-noteref"><sup>139</sup></a> A name is a label, not a process. So sensation, perception, and so forth, were not meant to be what ‘name’ <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">is</span> but what <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">bring it about</span>. The Buddha was then saying that the name is not an innate part of the being but something arisen through processes like attention and perception. In other words, the names of beings in reality are nothing more than constructs formed by the mind based on its experiences.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Accepting this suggestion requires some assumptions, however, because no sutta says how or even <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">if</span> these five factors would be involved in such a process. At best a dense passage in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> on “designation contact” (<a href="#bqseg109"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§109</span></a>) may hint at such ideas, but it leaves almost all of the factors of the definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> unmentioned. So on the basis of the earliest texts this idea has to remain speculative.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As will be discussed later, consciousness is said to be dependent on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. With this in mind, let me propose another possible reason for the specific factors in the definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>. It could be that the factors emphasize specific things consciousness depends on.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140" role="doc-noteref"><sup>140</sup></a> Some passages say it relies on sense impressions and mental engagement (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samannāhāra</span>), a synonym for attention; it also relies on sensations and perception, which are intrinsically linked with it; and in the default sequence of Dependent Arising it is preceded by willful actions, which is synonymous with intentions.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141" role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a> This neatly covers all five factors. Other conditions for consciousness, such as the physical senses, may then perhaps be included under <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But whatever the Buddha’s exact intentions behind the definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> may have been, this definition is only a minor teaching in the suttas, one which plays no critical role in the standard teachings on Dependent Arising, where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> conventionally refers to the individual. The definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>, whatever its exact implications, is only a secondary layer on top of this, likely intended to challenge ideas about names being an intrinsic part of the being.</p>

Realizing that at this point in the chain [of Dependent Arising] there should be a reference to the emergence of the individual person, and knowing that the Buddha identified the person with the five khandhas, the tradition made <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarupa</span> equivalent to the five <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>” (with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> encompassing four of them, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> being the fifth).<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143" role="doc-noteref"><sup>143</sup></a> Gombrich then correctly states that the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span>’s definition is not in accordance with the suttas, where the consciousness is always separate from <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. This definition seems to be relatively early, though, for it was also used by the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sarvāstivādins</span> in the Saṁyukta Āgama, who thus shared the same general interpretation as the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Theravādins</span>.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144" role="doc-noteref"><sup>144</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>An earlier layer of the Pāli <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span>, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Vibhaṅga</span>, defined <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> only as three aspects of existence: sensation, perception, and will.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145" role="doc-noteref"><sup>145</sup></a> While this definition still differs from the suttas, by omitting consciousness it aligns better with the sutta definition. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Vibhaṅga</span> realized that the aspect of existence of will (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>) is effectively equal to intention. The Majjhima Nikāya commentary further suggests that alongside intention, sense impression and attention should also be seen as part of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146" role="doc-noteref"><sup>146</sup></a> This seems to me somewhat of a stretch, but with intention being equivalent to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>, the Buddha’s definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> does contain three of the five aspects of existence (sensation and perception being the other two). And since <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> also includes the aspect of existence of form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>), the compound functionally contains four of the five aspects of existence. From a pragmatic perspective the arising of consciousness along with the individual’s immaterial aspects and body is therefore equivalent to the arising of the five aspects of existence—which, as mentioned before, refers to the birth of the individual person.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Śāriputra Abhidharma</span>, which according to Frauwallner has an ancient core, seems to define <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">nāma</span> with the same factors as the Pāli suttas, as do some parallels in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Ekottarika Āgama</span>.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147" role="doc-noteref"><sup>147</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Paṭisambhidāmagga</span>, an early Pāli commentary, defines it with these factors as well, although it also adds some other observations.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148" role="doc-noteref"><sup>148</sup></a> This definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> seems to be the earliest one, in part also because it is the most difficult reading.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> part of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is defined by the Buddha as, “the four elements, along with form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>) derived from the four elements”.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149" role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a> Like other ancient civilizations, the Indians believed that the world was made of the elements of earth, water, fire, and air. Unfortunately, the suttas never directly explain what the form <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">derived from</span> these four elements is,<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150" role="doc-noteref"><sup>150</sup></a> and the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span>’s explanation seems way too contrived. I understand the elements to be the abstract qualities of solidity, fluidity, heat, and movement, and the form derived from them to be specific manifestations of these qualities, such as rocks, water droplets, or flames—or in the case of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, the various parts of the body.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>A number of suttas tell us that physical form can be internal or external.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151" role="doc-noteref"><sup>151</sup></a> <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">The Longer Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint</span> explains that internal form is parts of the body, such as bones and skin in the case of the element of earth, and saliva and sweat in the case of the element of water. External form is things outside of the person, such as the water in the ocean in the case of the element of water, and a fire in a village in the case of the element of fire.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152" role="doc-noteref"><sup>152</sup></a> We have seen that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in the standard sequence of Dependent Arising refers to the being, which means that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> here refers to the internal (or ‘personal’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ajjhattaṁ</span>) elements, not the external.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This is akin to how the factor of the six senses (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saḷāyatana</span>) refers to the internal six sense faculties of the eyes, ears, and so on, not to the external objects of sights, sounds, etc. Although in some texts the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saḷāyatana</span> encompasses both the senses <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">and</span> their objects, as a factor of Dependent Arising it is specifically defined as the senses only, excluding the objects. To illustrate, the Analysis of the Six Sense Spheres says:</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This shows that the external sense objects are not part of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saḷāyatana</span> in Dependent Arising.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156" role="doc-noteref"><sup>156</sup></a> While sometimes the six sense faculties are specifically called ‘internal’, when <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saḷāyatana</span> is used as a factor of Dependent Arising, it is assumed that the audience understands it refers to these internal senses, not to external objects. The same applies to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>: it is not specifically said to refer to the internal elements that compose the being’s physical form, but context indicates that it does. The water of the ocean and fires in a village do not exist in the mother’s womb, for example.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I mentioned that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> is defined as the four elements. Direct connections between the body and the four elements are also made throughout the Nikāyas. A common phrase says “this body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kāya</span>) consists of form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>), is made up of the four elements”.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Satippaṭṭhāna Sutta</span> instructs meditators to look at their body as consisting of the four elements, like a butcher might look at the various cuts of a cow.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158" role="doc-noteref"><sup>158</sup></a> This instruction aims to remove attachment to the body. This also seems to be the primary intent behind the definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> in context of Dependent Arising. Earlier I argued that the Buddha’s definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> is not an exact classification of parts of the being but a means to contemplate the absence of a self. With <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> the situation is similar. Its definition is not a metaphysical statement on what ‘form’ really is, but a way to contemplate that the body is a part of nature. As with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>, the Buddha is not saying “this is what I <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">mean</span> by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>” but “this is how this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> should be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">looked at</span>”. We should look at the body as made of the elements, of aspects of nature that we do not own and cannot control.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>According to Hamilton, this is also why the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> is used rather than <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kāya</span> (body): “It stresses that the body is comprised of a group of processes which are classified according to four kinds of characteristics [of] solidity, fluidity, heat, and motion, [which] allows the reader to gain more understanding of how the body is constituted in a way the designation <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kāya</span> does not.”<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159" role="doc-noteref"><sup>159</sup></a> I would add that in our day and age we might prefer to look at the body as made of chemical elements or atoms. This would serve the same function as the Buddha’s definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>, at least in this context. (I should note again that the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> can have other connotations which do not apply in the current context.)</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Considering the Buddha’s pragmatism, ‘definition’ may even be a wrong way to think about these things. Instead of strict, technical classifications, we are dealing with didactics (ways of teaching), not only in the case of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> but also for some of the other factors. Consider craving:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§31</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And what is craving? There are six kinds of craving: craving for sights, craving for sounds, craving for smells, craving for flavors, craving for tangibles, and craving for mental phenomena. That is what’s called craving.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If the Buddha meant to explain what craving exactly <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">is</span>, we would be better helped with synonyms for craving or with an explanation of how it functions. This list tells us absolutely nothing about what craving is. But it does remind us of the things we crave <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">for</span>, and that is helpful. We encountered a similar case already at <a href="#bqseg2"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§2</span></a>: the definition of consciousness as consisting of six types. It doesn’t really tell us what consciousness exactly is, but it tells us what things we can be conscious of. When the Buddha concludes this definition with, “that is what’s called consciousness”, in this case it means something like, “what you call ‘consciousness’ in reality is this”—which is to say, it is not a homogeneous entity that underlies all experience, but something made up of six different types of consciousness. Similarly, the definitions of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> are to be seen as didactic tools.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-space">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To summarize the main ideas of this chapter, the factor of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the individual, and its two components represent certain aspects of that individual, which is why I translate it as ‘the individual’s immaterial aspects and body’. These things exist throughout the being’s entire lifespan, but their <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">arising</span> refers specifically to the start of life, to the being’s conception. The Buddha adapted the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣadic</span> Brahmins, or more likely from general society, to whom it meant the individual with their visible form and intrinsic name. His definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> was meant to challenge traditional ideas about names being part of oneself, and his definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> meant to challenge attachments to the body.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To close this chapter properly, it has to be noted that although the oldest use of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was a referent for individual beings,<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160" role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a> it was also used for individual <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">objects</span>. “The essence of a thing was expressed in its name and its visible appearance”, wrote Patrick Olivelle in the introduction to his translations of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>, with ‘thing’ meaning a person or an object.<a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161" role="doc-noteref"><sup>161</sup></a> This philosophy seems to have resulted at least in part from the belief that objects had within them the essence of divine beings that bore their names. Campfires, for instance, as well as cooking fires, forest fires, and all other fires, were all considered to be part of the god Agni, whose name just means Fire. There was, to some Brahmins at least, no separation between the divine and the worldly, and hence also no clear boundary between the animate and inanimate. All bore intrinsic names and forms. But while <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to external objects with some regularity in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>, in the Pāli Canon the word is used in this fashion very rarely, and always outside the standard teachings on Dependent Arising. Because of the minor place of this so-called <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">external</span> name and form, its discussion can wait until <a href="#chapter9"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Chapter 9</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><a href="#chapter8"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Chapter 8</span></a> explains <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> further, particularly its dependency on consciousness. Now we have a basic understanding of the concept, we can return to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>, starting with the simile of the painting.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To recall the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§32</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>It’s like an artist or painter producing a complete figure of a man or woman on a well-polished board, a wall, or a canvas, using dye, lac, turmeric, indigo, and crimson.

Where consciousness is planted and sprouts, there is a conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. Where there is a conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, willful actions develop [their results]. Where willful actions develop, existence in a future life is produced. Where existence in a future life is produced, there is future birth, old age, and death. Where there is future birth, old age, and death, there will be sorrow, anxiety, and distress, I tell you.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Before turning to the actual simile, I want to address the order of the factors, which is as follows:</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Craving, desire, and enjoyment</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">

</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Birth, followed by old age and death and other suffering</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the standard sequence of Dependent Arising, willful actions precede consciousness, but here they are mentioned later. On this basis the commentary concludes that factors 2 and 5 signify two separate rebirths, with the planting of consciousness being the start of one life and the production of existence being the start of another. But this approaches the text too analytically, not allowing any flexibility in the order of the terms. Factors 2 through 6 instead all refer to a single rebirth. The word ‘where’ should be understood as the place of rebirth (as the commentary does note correctly) and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">where</span> consciousness is reborn, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">there</span> the immaterial aspects and body are conceived, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">there</span> willful actions develop, and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">there</span> a future life is produced. These things happen more or less in tandem, not sequentially. The order of factors therefore does not signify anything out of the ordinary. More significantly, as some readers may already have noticed, the factor following consciousness is not just ‘willful actions’ but ‘the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">development</span> of willful actions’. This refers to the outcome of the actions, not the actions themselves. The outcome of willful actions is a specific rebirth with its attributes.</p>

<p>Regarding the simile of the painting, it is just a single line, but it contains a lot: “It’s like an artist or painter producing a complete figure of a man or woman on a well-polished board, a wall, or a canvas, using dye, lac, turmeric, indigo, and crimson.” This is a metaphor for how willful actions determine the quality of one’s birth and thereby one’s immaterial aspects and body.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163" role="doc-noteref"><sup>163</sup></a> In detail: the artist or painter (wholesome or unwholesome actions) produces a complete figure of a man or woman (an incarnation) on a board, wall, or canvas (the sensual, formed, or formless realm) using five paints (the five aspects of existence). Further, the word for ‘figure’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>) in “producing a complete figure of a man or woman” refers to the bodily part of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. Even ‘producing’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhinibbatti</span>) refers to rebirth. It is also used in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, which mentions the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">production</span> of the immaterial aspects and body in the mother’s womb;<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164" role="doc-noteref"><sup>164</sup></a> in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> itself in “existence in a future life is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">produced</span>”; and in the very definition of birth at <a href="#bqseg20"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§20</span></a>.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Despite the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> mentioning future birth and the production of existence in a future life, some interpreters do not think the simile of the painting is about rebirth, believing it instead illustrates the formation of certain thought constructs or cognitions.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165" role="doc-noteref"><sup>165</sup></a> But there is a reason the painted figure is specifically a being, not a lifeless object like a bowl of fruit or a landscape: the simile specifically depicts the production of a next life. This is further clarified by the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Second Discourse on the Leash</span>, where the Buddha uses the same simile to describe the varieties of births beings produce within transmigration (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>):</p>

Whenever he would walk, stand, sit, or lie down, he would do so right beside that post or pillar. Likewise, unlearned ordinary people regard form to be them, to be theirs, to be their self. They regard sensation, perception, will, and consciousness to be them, to be theirs, to be their self. Whenever they walk, stand, sit, or lie down, they do so right along those five taken up aspects of existence. Therefore, you should regularly reflect upon your mind, thinking: ‘For a long time this mind has been contaminated with desire, anger, and delusion.’ Beings are contaminated because the mind is contaminated.

<p>This is how I understand the primary messages of this sutta: Our minds have been defiled for a long time (meaning many lifetimes) and because of this we have been going through the cycle of birth and death for a long time. Throughout our journey, obstructed by ignorance and chained by craving, like a dog leashed to a pillar, we have been reborn as animals (probably even as dogs) and also in many other circumstances. But wherever we were reborn, life was always just the five aspects of existence, which we foolishly desired and mistakenly took to be ‘us’. Wherever we were reborn, we always reproduced these five aspects of existence and never went beyond them, like the dog can’t ever leave his pillar. The mind is responsible for creating all these various rebirths, just like painters are responsible for their paintings.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The preceding sutta in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Saṁyutta Nikāya</span>, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">First Discourse on the Leash</span>, also clarifies these ideas. It specifically says that if one keeps circling like a dog around the five aspects of existence, one is not liberated from <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">birth</span>.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168" role="doc-noteref"><sup>168</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As a sidenote, the name of the picture ‘Wandering’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">caraṇa</span>) can also be translated as ‘Conduct’. About this picture the commentary says, in Venerable Bodhi’s translation: “The Sankha were a sect of heretical Brahmins. Having taken a canvas, they had various pictures painted on it of the good and bad destinations to illustrate success and failure, and then they took it around on their wanderings. They would show it to the people, explaining, ‘If one does this deed, one gets this result; if one does that, one gets that.’”<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169" role="doc-noteref"><sup>169</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Much more could be said about this discourse, which is also full of puns that don’t show in translation, but my point here is merely that the simile of the painting refers to the creation of rebirth in this discourse, and therefore it also does in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>. This in turn tells us something about the simile of the light beam in that same discourse, namely that it is about the cessation of rebirth.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But that simile will be discussed only in <a href="#chapter11"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Chapter 11</span></a>. First we will have a further look at the factors of willful actions and consciousness.</p>

<h1 id='CHAPTER-5.-Karma-and-rebirth'>5. Karma and rebirth</h1>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Just as the quality of a painting is determined by the skill of its painter, the quality of a being’s rebirth is determined by the moral wholesomeness of the actions performed throughout their life. To simplify, like bad painters make ugly paintings and good painters make beautiful ones, bad actions lead to bad rebirths and good actions to good ones. This chapter discusses how this principle relates to the factors of willful actions and consciousness.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">

<p>Given the direct connection with Dependent Arising in these verses and elsewhere,<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172" role="doc-noteref"><sup>172</sup></a> deeds should fit somewhere in the twelvefold scheme, and the primary if not only candidate is willful actions. (By ‘willful’ I mean ‘intentional/volitional’, not ‘stubborn’.) The Pāli for ‘willful actions’ is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>.

The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sāleyyaka Sutta</span> is a good example of this. It also clarifies the above groupings, saying: “Physical conduct that’s principled and moral is threefold. Verbal conduct that’s principled and moral is fourfold. Mental conduct that’s principled and moral is threefold.”<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187" role="doc-noteref"><sup>187</sup></a> The Buddha then divides these three groups of conduct into the same ten listed above.</p>

<p>Throughout the discourses <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kamma</span> (deeds) focuses on ethical conduct of this sort. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Saṅkhāra</span> (willful actions) often has a somewhat more technical slant, being more closely connected to the rebirth process itself.

</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Karma-and-ignorance'>Karma and ignorance</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Willful actions are said to be done out of ignorance, and in the following verses Raṭṭhapāla says deeds are done out of delusion. As observed earlier, delusion is a close synonym for ignorance, so these verses again show that deeds and willful actions are synonyms too.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The dependency of deeds on ignorance is also mentioned in an interesting exchange between Mahāmoggallāna, the Buddha, and a Jain named Vappa. Like other Jains, Vappa had a different idea of karma than the Buddha.<a href="#fn197" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197" role="doc-noteref"><sup>197</sup></a> The Jains thought <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">all</span> actions bind one to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, regardless of intention. The only way to not create any karma therefore was being totally inactive, especially physically. Even eating was considered karma, so this inactivity went on until the Jain saint starved himself to death. But what mattered to the Buddha are the intentions behind the deeds. And because wrong intentions exist only in the deluded mind, to make karma stop, ignorance needs to be removed.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Like other Jains, Vappa also believed karma to attract physical particles that flow into and stick to the soul. These particles (also called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āsavas</span>, ‘defilements’)<a href="#fn198" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198" role="doc-noteref"><sup>198</sup></a> weigh the soul down, binding it to earth. They can only be worn away by long periods of abstinence from any actions. Even if your behavior is completely pure in this life, rebirth will still happen if these karmic particles are not yet completely worn away. The Buddha’s response to this belief is predictable: the defilements are completely removed as soon as ignorance disappears. Then all results of previous karma end at death, after which there will be no more rebirth. The Buddha phrased his response to Vappa as a question, which I will clarify afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

<p>[The Buddha:] “What do you think, Vappa?

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The exchange contains a lot of Jain terminology used in a different sense by the Buddha, which makes it impossible to translate accurately.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201" role="doc-noteref"><sup>201</sup></a> So if the passage sounds a bit odd, that is why. I hope the general idea is clear regardless. According to the Buddha, if you are enlightened, you still feel the results of past karma, because it created this life, but ignorance is gone, so you don’t do any new karma, and therefore you will not be reborn. The remainder of the discourse illustrates this further. The Buddha says liberated mendicants still experience sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, and mental phenomena—that is, they still have the six senses as a result of past deeds—but when they die, all that is experienced, not being desired, will “cool off”.</p>

<p>Knowing that deeds (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">kamma</span>) are based on intentions and that they lead to the six senses through rebirth, we can also make sense of statements such as this:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Concerning that, as a noble disciple you closely and properly focus on the dependent arising of things, reflecting: ‘There will be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">this</span>, only if there is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">that</span>. <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">This</span> arises, because <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">that</span> arises. If there isn’t <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">that</span>, there won’t be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">this</span>. If <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">that</span> ceases, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">this</span> will cease. That is to say:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Dependent on ignorance, there are willful actions. Dependent on willful actions, consciousness. Dependent on consciousness, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. … That is how this whole mass of suffering originates.</p>

<p>But if ignorance completely fades away and ceases, willful actions will cease. If willful actions cease, consciousness will cease. If consciousness ceases, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body will cease. … That is how this whole mass of suffering ceases.’<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203" role="doc-noteref"><sup>203</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The six senses and the body are said to be experienced, which means they must be experienced until one passes away, even for the enlightened. They should be seen as created, which refers to their creation at the start of life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The word for ‘created’ here is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhisaṅkhata</span>, a verb connected to the noun <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>. So when the Buddha says the six senses and body should be seen as created, this also means they are the result of willful actions. Hence I used the compound expression ‘created by will’ for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhisaṅkhata</span>, following Venerable Sujato’s example.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204" role="doc-noteref"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Translating <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span> is complicated in part because the word is not only used for the act of creating; it is also employed for the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">outcome</span> of the creative act. This is similar to the English word ‘creation’, which can indicate both the active act and the passive outcome of it, as in “the creation of a creation”. The passive meaning applies to phrases such as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā</span>, ‘all that is created [through rebirth] is suffering’,<a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205" role="doc-noteref"><sup>205</sup></a> but it does not apply to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span> as a factor in Dependent Arising, which are the active physical, verbal, and mental actions that create rebirth.<a href="#fn206" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206" role="doc-noteref"><sup>206</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The next passage speaks on these two sides of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span> too. It is impossible to convey the linguistic connections in translation without losing some of the meaning, so I included the Pāli alongside.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As already indicated by the linguistic twists, this is not a hard-and-fast definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span> but more a loose, almost playful explanation of why the word is used. The explanation of ‘form’ in the same sutta even contains an unmistakable pun.<a href="#fn210" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210" role="doc-noteref"><sup>210</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The idea here is that willful actions are the creative forces in the rebirth process. Along with craving they fabricate the aspects of existence of the future life. Venerable Sumedhā therefore says in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Therīgāthā</span>: “The aspects of existence, elements, and senses are created (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhata</span>), rooted in <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">birth</span>.”<a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211" role="doc-noteref"><sup>211</sup></a> This aligns with the definition of birth (<a href="#bqseg20"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§20</span></a>), which includes the manifestation of the aspects of existence and the obtainment of the sense faculties. The Buddha similarly said about the five aspects of existence that they are “created, dependently arisen”.<a href="#fn212" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212" role="doc-noteref"><sup>212</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Now we are also able to understand why in the simile of the painting willful actions are represented by a painter. A painter is a <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">creator</span>.

<p>Another discourse linking willful actions directly to birth is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Precipice Discourse</span>. This discourse also serves as a great example of the Buddha’s skillful use of metaphors, which in this case he appears to make up on the spot:</p>

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Willful-actions-leading-to-consciousness'>Willful actions leading to consciousness</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With a basic understanding of the factor of willful actions, we can now consider how it connects to consciousness in the standard phrase, “dependent on willful actions, there is consciousness”. This will also clarify what the planting (or ‘establishing’) of consciousness refers to. To start, let’s consider the first paragraph of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">First Discourse on Intention</span>, which describes the continuation of consciousness in a next life as a result of certain intentions, plans, and tendencies:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§53</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg53" class="anchor"></span>Mendicants, what you intend, what you plan, and what you have a tendency towards, that is a foundation for the continuation of consciousness [after death]. If there is a foundation, there will be a support for the planting of consciousness.<a href="#fn215" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215" role="doc-noteref"><sup>215</sup></a> If consciousness is planted, it will sprout, and then existence in a future life is produced. If existence in a future life is produced, future birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress will come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates.<a href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216" role="doc-noteref"><sup>216</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The phrase “what you intend, what you plan, and what you have a tendency towards” is a reference to willful actions, as is evident from the word ‘intend’ and from it being placed before the continuation of consciousness, just as willful actions precede consciousness in the default sequence. Functionally the three items of this phrase overlap to a large extent. They are not further detailed in the early texts, but I reflect on some of their differences as follows:</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘What you intend’ implies not only intentions around the moment of death but also intentional actions done throughout life. These can be recollected around death, causing remorse and elation, making one feel deserving of a certain rebirth. A discourse in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span> speaks of someone falling seriously ill, reflecting on their bad deeds, and deciding that after death they must go to a bad place. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on the Foolish and Wise</span> in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Majjhima Nikāya</span> mentions the same recollections, and then also says these “fools” are indeed reborn in a bad place.<a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref217" role="doc-noteref"><sup>217</sup></a></p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘What you plan’ includes intentions to be reborn in a specific place. This is described in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on Rebirth Through Will</span> (<span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Saṅkhāra-upapatti Sutta</span>), a text which also brings out the connection between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāras</span> and rebirth.<a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218" role="doc-noteref"><sup>218</sup></a></p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘What you have a tendency towards’ refers to subtler underlying attachments that can trigger the will at death. It essentially represents ignorance and craving.<a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219" role="doc-noteref"><sup>219</sup></a> The tendency (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anusaya</span>) of desire for existence,<a href="#fn220" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220" role="doc-noteref"><sup>220</sup></a> for example, may only surface when one is faced with imminent death.</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discourse says these three are “a foundation for the continuation of consciousness” and “a support for the planting of consciousness”. The <span data-custom-style="Strong">continuation</span> of consciousness means its continuation <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">after death</span>, as others have also argued, not some sort of continuation while one is still alive.<a href="#fn221" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221" role="doc-noteref"><sup>221</sup></a> This should already be evident from the subsequent phrase alone: “then existence in a future life is produced”. The general continuation of consciousness during life also does not depend on willful actions, so this can’t be what is referred to here. To illustrate, the consciousness of enlightened beings still continues as long as they live, even though they have no ignorance and resulting willful actions. The <span data-custom-style="Strong">planting</span> of consciousness is the mind moving on towards a certain place of rebirth, where it then “sprouts”, meaning the next life is started.<a href="#fn222" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222" role="doc-noteref"><sup>222</sup></a> The next chapter illustrates this further with the simile of the seed of consciousness. The Chinese parallel skips this phrase and even more directly says: “When there is a foundation for the continuation of consciousness, there is future <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">birth</span> [and so on].”<a href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223" role="doc-noteref"><sup>223</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">First Discourse on Intention</span> is part of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>, the connected discourses on Dependent Arising, so we should compare it to the standard sequence. The discourse effectively follows another route through the factors: willful actions (2) › consciousness (3) › existence (10) › birth (11) › suffering (12). This reconfirms that the ignorance and craving sequences are parallel descriptions of the same process.</p>

<p>The sutta that follows the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">First Discourse on Intention</span>, unsurprisingly called the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Second Discourse on Intention</span>, also helps bring home all these points. It is more similar to the standard sequence of Dependent Arising, showing more clearly that ‘what you intend’ refers to the factor of willful actions. The conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, which we have seen refers to the conception and birth of a being, reoccurs here too.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">First Discourse on Intention</span>, the planting of consciousness is followed by the production of existence in a future life; in the Second it is followed by the conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. So the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">production</span> of a future life must be equivalent to the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">conception</span> of the immaterial aspects and body. And indeed, the words ‘production’ and ‘conception’ are both part of the definition of birth: “The birth of any kind of being into whatever order of beings—them being born, their <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">conception</span>, their <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">production</span>, their aspects of existence manifesting, them obtaining the sense faculties.” The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Saṁyukta Āgama</span> parallel to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Second Discourse on Intention</span> even places birth (生) directly after the conception of the immaterial aspects and body.<a href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225" role="doc-noteref"><sup>225</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All this confirms once again that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the being and that its conception means rebirth. It also shows that the planting of consciousness, which precedes this conception, is part of the rebirth process too.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The connections between ignorance, willful actions, and consciousness are also explained in another discourse in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>. It says consciousness will ‘travel on’ as a result of ignorant willful actions which are either meritorious, demeritorious, or undisturbable. (‘Meritorious’ and ‘demeritorious’ are synonyms for ‘wholesome’ and ‘unwholesome’, meaning good and bad.)<a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref226" role="doc-noteref"><sup>226</sup></a></p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discourse that defines karma as intention uses similar terminology in the phrase: “Influenced by ignorance you produce a corresponding incarnation according to your merit or demerit.”<a href="#fn228" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228" role="doc-noteref"><sup>228</sup></a> We discussed the term ‘produce’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhinibbati</span>) before, which can also be translated as ‘rebirth’. So a connection is made here between ignorance, karma, and rebirth. The above passage on consciousness traveling on speaks on the same ideas, on rebirth happening according to one’s ignorant meritorious or demeritorious actions.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This can also be derived from the term ‘travel on’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upaga</span>) itself, which in this context refers to traveling on after death.<a href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229" role="doc-noteref"><sup>229</sup></a> Later passages clarify this when mentioning that “when their body falls apart, fools will <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">travel on</span> to another body”, and that with the psychic power of divine sight “you see beings passing on and being reborn, understanding that they <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">travel on</span> according to their deeds”.<a href="#fn230" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230" role="doc-noteref"><sup>230</sup></a> The connection between ‘deeds’ and ‘travel on’ in the latter example is the same as that between ‘willful actions’ and the ‘traveling on’ of consciousness in the above passage.</p>

<p>I do not want to get lost in the details here, but in brief, going by the examples of the various beings that are given for each abode, the first abode for consciousness is the sensual realm; the second, third and fourth are part of the realm with form; and the fifth, sixth and seventh are part of the realm without form. In other texts other subdivisions are made, so it seems unimportant what the exact distinctions between these seven abodes are. The more significant message is that all existence is within a certain abode of consciousness. Even beings in the highest realms are subject to the dependent arising of consciousness as a result of willful actions, which means they too are reborn in a certain place because of their intentions and actions.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This part focuses on discourses that treat consciousness as a metaphorical seed which gets planted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭhita</span>) in a next life. Some of them, particularly the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> (<a href="#bqseg76"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§76</span></a>), also include the four nutriments, which we already encountered in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>. Since a basic knowledge of these four nutriments is assumed by these texts, I will share my understanding of them first.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-four-nutriments-and-rebirth'>The four nutriments and rebirth</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the canon the Buddha regularly mentions four nutriments (literally ‘foods’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āhāras</span>). These nutriments he says “maintain beings who are born and support those to be reborn”. That is to say, these nutriments perform two functions: they maintain the life of beings who are already born, and they are involved in their rebirth. The former is not the concern of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>, where the matter at hand is only how the four nutriments lead to rebirth. The same is true for the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span>, as we shall see. Both discourses explain what happens when there is desire, enjoyment, and attachment, which don’t keep beings alive who are already born (e.g., enlightened beings continue to live without them), but they do cause rebirth, and this is what these discourses are concerned with. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> we were also able to derive this from phrases like “the conception of the individual’s immaterial aspects and body”. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> even directly mentions rebirth (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upapatti</span>). Throughout the canon the main focus of the four nutriments also is rebirth. However, in the following I will also touch upon how they facilitate existence in the present life, how they maintain beings who are already born.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The four nutriments are edible food, sense impressions, intentions, and consciousness. The primary explanation of these nutriments in the Pāli Canon is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Child’s Flesh Discourse</span>. The discourse is named after a rather gruesome simile which instructs monks and nuns to not eat more food than necessary, just like parents stuck in the middle of the desert would not eat more of their child’s flesh than they would need to survive. This simile is not of relevance to our main discussion, because it is about how physical food keeps alive beings who are already born. The same applies to the nutriment of sense impressions, which is illustrated with a skinned cow who gets bitten by insects wherever she tries to hide. This refers to the fact that the six senses are unavoidable suffering for anybody who is born. So this simile too is not about rebirth but about what happens while being alive.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>However, the similes for the nutriments of intentions and consciousness—respectively, being dragged into a charcoal pit and being stabbed by spears—<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">do</span> illustrate rebirth. And even though the similes for edible food and sense impressions concern those already born, in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Child’s Flesh Discourse</span> the Buddha still explains, apart from the similes, how these two nutriments lead to rebirth.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">The nutriment of edible food</span> (more literally ‘food of solid food’—it’s a bit of a pun) symbolizes all sensual pleasures. This is because good food entices most of the physical senses—tasting, looking, and smelling good—but also because the desire to enjoy food is only fully abandoned when all sensual desires are abandoned. Sensual pleasures themselves do not cause rebirth: it’s the desire for them that does. When at death there is still a yearning for certain sensual pleasures, it can lead to rebirth in the sensual realm. To recall our central discourse, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>: “If there is desire, enjoyment, and craving for the nutriment of edible food [after death] a future life is produced.” Here the desire, enjoyment, and craving refer to the causes of rebirth in the sensual realm, the desires for sensual pleasures. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Child’s Flesh Discourse</span> accordingly says:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When you fully understand the nutriment of edible food, you fully understand the desire for the objects of the five senses.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The absence of any chain that binds one to this world refers to the non-returners, who have abandoned all desires for the five senses. They have removed the five chains (or ‘fetters’) that tie them to rebirth in the sensual realm.</p>

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">The nutriment of sense impressions (or ‘contact’)</span> also implies the pleasant, painful, and neutral sensations that result from sense impressions. Just like with edible food, sense impressions and sensations themselves are not a nutriment for rebirth: it is the desire for them that is. Non-returners have abandoned desire for sensations coming from the five senses, but only fully enlightened beings have abandoned desire for all sensations, including those of the mind.

<p>The three kinds of sensations are the pleasant, painful, and neutral ones.

<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">The nutriment of intention</span> refers to willful actions, which at death steer the mind towards certain realms of rebirth.

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>And, mendicants, how should you look at the nutriment of intention? Imagine a charcoal pit deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked. A man would come along who wanted to live and not die, who wanted pleasure and was averse to pain. But two strong men would grab him by the arms and dragged him towards that charcoal pit. The man’s volition, aim, and aspiration would be to get far away from that pit. Why? Because he would think: ‘If I fall into that charcoal pit, that will result in death or in deadly pains!’ Mendicants, that is how you should look at the nutriment of intention, I tell you.</p>

Figure 11. A charcoal pit as a simile for rebirth</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the simile we might initially assume that the nutriment of intention is represented by the man’s desire to get away from the pit, but the commentary astutely suggests it is instead represented by the two strong men, being unwholesome and wholesome (but still deluded) willful actions.<a href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237" role="doc-noteref"><sup>237</sup></a> These willful actions lead to rebirth, as illustrated in the previous chapter. Being thrown in the pit stands for being reborn, and the “death or deadly pains” are the suffering and death that result from being reborn. The man’s desire to avoid the glowing coals stands for the desire to avoid suffering. Desire alone is not enough to overcome suffering, though: one needs to overcome the intentions, the two strong men, through wisdom.</p>

<p>“And how should you look at the nutriment of consciousness? Imagine a thief, a criminal, would be caught and brought before a king. They would say: ‘Sire, this man is a thief, a criminal.

At noon the king would ask: ‘How is that man doing?’—‘Still alive, sire.’—And the king would say: ‘Go and stab him with a hundred spears again!’ And at noon he would be stabbed with a hundred spears again.

Figure 12. Spears as a simile for the rebirth of consciousness</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The simile of the spears does not explicitly refer to rebirth here, but elsewhere it more clearly does. In a discourse called <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">A Hundred Spears</span>, the Buddha says that if you were given the choice of becoming a stream enterer in exchange for being stabbed with three hundred spears a day for a hundred years (a hundred in the morning, afternoon, and evening each) you should take the deal. Why? “Transmigration has no discernible beginning”, the Buddha explains.<a href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245" role="doc-noteref"><sup>245</sup></a> The many spears you would avoid by taking the deal stand for the amount of potential rebirths you, as a stream winner, would no longer take. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Therīgāthā</span>, Venerable Sumedhā also refers to this simile. She says one should take the deal, because those who stay in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> get killed again and again.<a href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246" role="doc-noteref"><sup>246</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Child’s Flesh Discourse</span> the spears likewise stand for rebirth and re-death. Each spear stands for another life, for another “planting” of consciousness, each of which unavoidably ends in death. Repeated death is even directly implied: being stabbed by just a single spear will usually end one’s life, let alone hundreds! Each stab with a spear represents one rebirth and consequent death. Consciousness itself doesn’t “die”, though, since it keeps coming back to future existences. The king stands for karma, say the commentaries, because he casts the judgment, like we judge our past actions and determine our rebirth based on that.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>After giving the simile of the spears, the Buddha connects consciousness directly to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, the individual’s immaterial aspects and body:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§64</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When you fully understand the nutriment of consciousness, you fully understand the immaterial aspects and body. When you, as a noble disciple, fully understand the immaterial aspects and body, there is nothing further for you to do.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This is another indication the simile is about rebirth. The arising of consciousness along with the individual’s immaterial aspects and body occurs at birth, as discussed in <a href="#chapter3"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Chapter 3</span></a>, and as later chapters will clarify. Helmut Hecker understood the simile in the same way: “[Consciousness] always nourishes rebirth, descending into a womb, and building a new name and form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>). Just as the robber in the simile did not die despite three hundred strokes, so, despite all the suffering of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>, consciousness does not die and does not want to. Again and again, it nourishes a mortal form (corporeality).”<a href="#fn247" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247" role="doc-noteref"><sup>247</sup></a></p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-two-functions-of-the-nutriment-of-consciousness'>The two functions of the nutriment of consciousness</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the above I mentioned that food and sense impressions themselves do not cause rebirth, that the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">desire</span> for them does so. With the nutriment of intention things are a little different, because it is primarily the intentions themselves that lead to rebirth, not the desire for them. The situation is still more complicated with the nutriment of consciousness, which is involved in rebirth in two ways: one is the desire for the continuation of consciousness after death, the other is consciousness as the so-called life force that perpetuates rebirth. On the latter Venerable Nyanaponika wrote: “Consciousness as a nutriment […] is explained primarily as rebirth consciousness.”<a href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248" role="doc-noteref"><sup>248</sup></a> This function of the nutriment of consciousness is also what the simile of the spears refers to, where each spear stands for a new rebirth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This function of the nutriment of consciousness is also clarified in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§65</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg65" class="anchor"></span>The nutriment of consciousness is a prerequisite for the production of existence in a future life. When the being is born, there are the six senses. Dependent on the six senses, there are sense impressions.<a href="#fn249" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249" role="doc-noteref"><sup>249</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Here the nutriment of consciousness stands for the consciousness that continues after death, or “the stream of consciousness coming from the preceding existence”, as Venerable Bodhi annotated this passage.<a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref250" role="doc-noteref"><sup>250</sup></a> This reminds us that all birth is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">re</span>birth, that it does not happen out of nowhere but as a continuation of a past being’s consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is worth pointing out that in this passage the phrase ‘the being is born’<a href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251" role="doc-noteref"><sup>251</sup></a> is positioned where we usually find the individual’s immaterial aspects and body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>): between consciousness and the six senses. This confirms the ideas of <a href="#chapter3"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Chapter 3</span></a>, where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was shown to refer to the being.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discussion in that chapter also included a passage from the Aṅguttara Nikāya where the conception of a fetus was connected directly to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> (<a href="#bqseg25"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§25</span></a>). I abbreviated the passage there, not showing that consciousness is also involved. Here is a more complete quotation:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§66</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg66" class="anchor"></span>These are these six elements: earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. […] From the six elements there is a conception of a fetus. When there is a conception, there are the individual’s immaterial aspects and body. Dependent on the individual’s immaterial aspects and body, there are the six senses. Dependent on the six senses, sense impressions. […]<a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref252" role="doc-noteref"><sup>252</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Usually the suttas speak of just four elements, but here space and consciousness are added. The resulting six elements are also mentioned in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Analysis of the Elements Discourse</span>, where they are said to constitute a person.<a href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253" role="doc-noteref"><sup>253</sup></a> This fits the above passage, where the six elements are conditions for the conception of the fetus, i.e. the person. The four standard elements together with space make up the body or form (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>) of the fetus. Relevant is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Longer Discourse on Advice to Rāhula</span>, which explains the four elements as various body parts and the “internal” space as the holes in the ears, the nose, the mouth, and so on.<a href="#fn254" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254" role="doc-noteref"><sup>254</sup></a> While <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> is normally explained as the four elements, in these cases space is included as a fifth.<a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref255" role="doc-noteref"><sup>255</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The element of consciousness, since it is said to be a condition for the conception of the fetus, must refer to consciousness that existed before birth, to consciousness that continued from the past life. This use of the term ‘consciousness’ as the carrier of life, if you will, will be further explained in <a href="#chapter8"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Chapter 8</span></a>. Because the six elements do not include any other mental aspects such as sensations or will, in this context consciousness stands more generally for person’s inner world as a whole, which I will also get back to. For now, just know that the term ‘consciousness’ is fluid.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If we compare the two previous extracts to the default sequence of Dependent Arising, the function of the factor of consciousness in the sequence is clarified. In <a href="#bqseg65"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§65</span></a> the nutriment of consciousness leads to the birth of a being; in <a href="#bqseg66"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§66</span></a> the element of consciousness leads to the conception of a fetus. Both passages then result in the six senses, followed by the rest of the standard sequence. Therefore, in the standard sequence the arising of consciousness and immaterial aspects and body refers to the same birth of a being and conception of a fetus.</p>

<p>The reestablishment of consciousness at birth (A4) depends on the four nutriments when they function as causes for rebirth (B1–4). To jump ahead a bit, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> therefore says: “consciousness with its [four] nutriments should be seen as the five kinds of seeds [for rebirth]”. The five seeds are the consciousness that moves from life to life (A4) plus the four nutriments as causes for rebirth (B1–4). The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> similarly mentioned: “If there is desire, enjoyment, and craving for the nutriment of edible food [or any of the other three nutriments], then consciousness will get planted and will sprout [in a next life].” The consciousness that gets planted is the continuing stream of consciousness that is supported by the desire for the four nutriments. This will all become clearer when we discuss the simile of the seed in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Not only are the four nutriments explained with similes (the charcoal pit, spears, etc.), the nutriments themselves are metaphorical too. How nutriment (or literally ‘food’) sustains day-to-day existence represents how craving sustains long-term existence through rebirth.

<p>Considering that beings have to eat to survive, at first this may seem an obvious statement. However, it includes <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">all</span> beings, including the heavenly ones, so it refers to something more profound than just physical food. Let me explain.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The basic idea that all beings require food is not originally the Buddha’s. The early <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span> state:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§69</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>From food are born all creatures; they live upon food, they are dissolved in food. Food is the chief of all things, the universal medicine. They who think of food as Spirit [Brahman], shall never lack. From food all beings are born, all beings increase their bulk; all beings feed upon it.<a href="#fn260" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260" role="doc-noteref"><sup>260</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The idea that all beings rely on food is one of the major themes of the entire Vedic corpus, including the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>. “Life and society are understood by the Vedic poets in terms of the basic struggle of acquiring food”, wrote Carlos Lopez.<a href="#fn261" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261" role="doc-noteref"><sup>261</sup></a> This struggle was not limited to humans. The departed ancestors and gods were also believed to constantly require food, and even the creator of the universe was. Only food could ensure their immortality. This meant <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">literal</span> food, such as butter, grains, and so on, which had to be offered to heavenly beings in sacrificial fires by those on earth. We find echoes of these ideas also in the Pāli Canon. Brahmins (of the more traditional kind) are doing fire sacrifices in a number of suttas, and one particular text talks in detail about the benefit of offering food to departed spirits.<a href="#fn262" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262" role="doc-noteref"><sup>262</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>K.R. Norman summarized the Buddha’s reply to these beliefs: “In Brahmanical thought we find the idea that food is required to sustain the existence of the inhabitants of other worlds or in the next life. The gods needed sacrifices as their food, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sanskrit">pitṛs</span> [ancestors] needed offerings to continue their existence […]. The Buddha, however, speaks of four sorts of food [<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āhāra</span>], which are instruments of continuity, and imply the future process of rebirth.”<a href="#fn263" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263" role="doc-noteref"><sup>263</sup></a> The importance society put on physical food may well explain why the Buddha chose to represent all sense pleasures with edible food. But he also played with these ideas in several other ways. By saying beings don’t just rely on physical food but also on “food” of sense impressions and consciousness, he questioned the validity of food offerings to the gods, who don’t actually need physical food to continue existing. More importantly, while to Brahmins food was considered a good thing—because it ensures a long or eternal life in heaven—the Buddha said the nutriments were a problem, exactly because they lead to more existence:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§70</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>Whatever suffering there may be,<br>
all originates dependent on intake of nutriments.<br>
If intake of nutriments ceases,<br>
no suffering will come to be.<a href="#fn264" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264" role="doc-noteref"><sup>264</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Buddha taught his disciples to be “hungerless” and no longer feed themselves on these nutriments. The idea is quite striking. If you stop eating, your life will soon come to an end. The Buddha is telling his disciples to no longer “eat” the four metaphorical nutriments, so they “starve” and won’t keep existing after death. In other words, if you stop craving, you will stop the intake (or uptake, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span>) of nutriments, which leads to the end of existence. This is stated in the cessation sequence as: “If craving ceases, fuel/taking up (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span>) will cease. If fuel/taking up ceases, existence will cease.” Here <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span> stands for both the nutriment (‘fuel’) and the intake of the nutriment. (To convey both ideas I use the dual translation ‘fuel/taking up’.) Statements such as this must have been especially challenging to the Brahmins, who worshipped both food and existence.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With the four nutriments, the Buddha used the life of a sentient being as a metaphor for continued existence after death, but he also frequently used the life of <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">plants</span> as a metaphor for these things. This chapter illustrates some of these metaphors, which shed a lot of light on the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> (‘consciousness is planted’).</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Consciousness-as-a-seed-for-rebirth'>Consciousness as a seed for rebirth</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>A prominent simile for rebirth in the canon is one wherein consciousness acts as a seed for rebirth. Earlier passages already implied this simile in phrases such as, “if consciousness is planted, it will sprout”. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bhava Sutta</span>, the Buddha describes it explicitly:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§71</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg71" class="anchor"></span>Venerable Ānanda approached the Buddha, bowed to him, and sat down to a side. He then asked: “Venerable sir, you mentioned existence (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>), but how is there existence?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Ānanda, would existence in the sensual worlds occur if there were no deeds that ripened [or ‘resulted’] in the sensual realm?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“So with deeds as the field, consciousness as the seed, and craving as the moisture, the consciousness of beings who are obstructed by ignorance and chained by craving, gets planted in the lower realm. That is how existence in a future life is produced.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

<p>Ānanda, that is how existence comes to be.”<a href="#fn266" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266" role="doc-noteref"><sup>266</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The word I translate as ‘planted’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭhita</span>) is usually translated as ‘established’. This translation is not wrong per se, but it does not fit the simile very well, because in English we wouldn’t say a seed is “established” in the ground. However, in Pāli seeds are “<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭhita</span>-ed” there. It is said, for example, that a farmer first ploughs his field and then plants (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭha</span>) his seeds.<a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267" role="doc-noteref"><sup>267</sup></a> So the translation ‘planted’ gives a better sense of how people at the time would have understood the term in this context.<a href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268" role="doc-noteref"><sup>268</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Using similar reasoning, I translate <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">virūḷhi</span> as ‘sprouting’. It too is part of the simile of the seed. In one passage the word is used with reference to a dormant seed of a creeper. Venerable Bodhi translated, following Venerable Ñāṇamoli: “Being moistened by rain from a rain-bearing cloud, the seed in due course sprouted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viruheyya</span>)”.<a href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269" role="doc-noteref"><sup>269</sup></a> Although in other contexts ‘growth’ might be a more suitable translation for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">virūḷhi</span>, considering this passage, ‘sprouting’ must be the intended meaning in the seed simile.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With that in mind, the general idea of the Buddha’s reply to Ānanda is as follows: When a being produces rebirth, the seed of their consciousness is metaphorically planted in a certain realm that aligns with their karma. Like bad fields produce bad plants and good field good plants, bad deeds lead to bad rebirths and good deeds to good ones. Wherever consciousness is reborn, there the next life with all its characteristics takes shape, which is represented by the seed sprouting and growing into a plant. In order to grow, a seed needs water too, and this water represents craving. For clarification, see the following illustrations:</p>

Figure 16. Plants as a simile for the quality of rebirth</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The three kinds of karma leading to rebirth in the three respective realms are similar to the demeritorious, meritorious, and undisturbable willful actions mentioned in <a href="#bqseg55"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§55</span></a>, which lead to consciousness traveling on to the respective places.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The sprouting of seeds is a striking representation of rebirth and would have been even more so in a society that was as agriculture-centered as the Buddha’s. It creates a very visual image of the cyclic nature of life. A plant develops a seed, which sprouts and grows into a new plant, which develops a new seed, and so forth. When the first plant dies, its offshoot will live into the future, in something like the plant’s next life. I think we would be hard-pressed to come up with a more fitting simile for rebirth.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Although it does seem to be implied by the simile, the idea of repeated plants growing from repeated seeds is not specifically mentioned in the early Pāli texts. But it is mentioned in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Questions of Milinda</span>, a late text included in the Burmese canon:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§72</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The king [Milinda] said: “Venerable Nāgasena, you speak of this ‘transmigration’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>). What is this transmigration?”</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Your Majesty, someone is born somewhere and dies there, and is reborn somewhere else. He is born there and dies there, and is reborn somewhere else again. That is how there is transmigration.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Can you give a simile?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“It’s like a person eats a ripe mango and plants its stone. It produces a big mango tree which grows fruits. Then the person eats a ripe mango from it and plants its stone.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The eating of the mango I understand to represent death, the shedding of the body. The stone (or pit) of the mango is the remaining part of the being which moves on to the next life. However, to be clear, this remaining part is also without any real essence. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Visuddhimagga</span> uses the same simile in context of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anatta</span>, reminding us there is no self involved in the process of rebirth, just like no part of the original tree is found in its ancestors.<a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref271" role="doc-noteref"><sup>271</sup></a></p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Verses-on-the-seed-simile'>Verses on the seed simile</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Throughout the Pāli Canon there are a number of verses that refer to the seed simile, in each case connecting it directly to rebirth. The first example is a set of verses spoken by the nun Selā:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§73</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>This puppet [i.e. being] is not made by oneself;<br>
this misery is not made by another.<br>
It has come into being dependent on conditions,<br>
and ceases by the destruction of those conditions.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>Just as a seed sprouts<br>
when sown in a field,<br>
based on two things:<br>
nutriments in the earth and moisture,</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>so the aspects of existence and the elements,<br>
and these six senses too,<br>
have come into being dependent on conditions,<br>
and cease by the destruction of those conditions.<a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref272" role="doc-noteref"><sup>272</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As often happens in verse, Selā points to certain similes assuming the listener knows what is being referred to. She effectively says that, just like a plant will sprout when a seed is planted in earth and given water, the being—the aspects of existence, six elements, and senses—will be reborn when it is supported by karma and craving.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>By saying that the being is not made by oneself and that it is just the aspects of existence, Selā also refers to the concept of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anatta</span>, the absence of a soul or self. The seed simile also conveys this idea, because the new plant, although it is directly linked to the parent plant through the seed, does not actually share any physical parts with it. Similarly, one life of a sentient being is linked to its next life through an ever-changing stream of consciousness. There is a clear connection between the two lives—it’s not a completely separate being after all—but nothing of essence, such as a soul, transfers from one life to the next.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The well-known <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Ratana Sutta</span> contains another verse on the seed simile. The Buddha says that the enlightened ones, with no desire for further existence, will not create a new life (“nothing new comes to be”). All existence (“the old”) comes to an end, because they have ended rebirth (“the seed”), and have no wish to be reborn (“to sprout”).</p>

<p>A less famous set of verses in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Suttanipāta</span> describes the same ideas.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All these verses did not mention consciousness to be the seed. We have a more basic metaphor, where the seed represents the possibility for rebirth more generally.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-Seeds-Discourse'>The Seeds Discourse</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Another text which equates consciousness to a seed is the Seeds Discourse. It has the same basic simile as the exchange with Ānanda on how existence comes to be (<a href="#bqseg71"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§71</span></a>) but it differs in some details:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Consciousness is still said to be the seed, but now it is joined by the four nutriments.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The seed is still said to be watered, now not by craving but by desire and enjoyment, which are just different manifestations of craving.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The seed is still said to be planted, now not in the field of karma but in the earth of the four aspects of existence other than consciousness. These ideas are closely linked, because the quality of one’s future aspects of existence is directly connected to the quality of one’s karma, like the quality of the earth is directly connected to the quality of the field.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discourse also specifically mentions the situation where the seed is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">not</span> planted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span>). Here it makes a new point, namely that consciousness can’t continue to exist without the other aspects of existence. To avoid any possible confusion, since consciousness is mentioned alongside the other four aspects of existence, it should be clear that ‘consciousness’ throughout the discourse simply refers to the fifth aspect of existence, whether it is planted or not planted, not to some “unestablished” consciousness outside of these five.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discourse is centered around rebirth, which is particularly evident when it mentions “the departing or arriving of consciousness, its passing on or rebirth”. The words ‘passing on’ (<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">cuti</span>) and ‘rebirth’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upapatti</span>) are sometimes translated along the lines of ‘passing away’ and ‘reappearing’, which may slightly obscure what they are about, but that they refer to rebirth is unambiguous in many places, one of which is the standard description of the psychic powers of past life recollection and the divine eye (or ‘divine sight’):</p>

<p>You direct [your mind] to knowing the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">passing on</span> and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">rebirth</span> of beings.

Those with bad physical, verbal, and mental conduct, who criticize the noble ones, have wrong view, and do deeds based on wrong view, get reborn in the lower plane, in a bad destination, a netherworld, a hell. But those with good physical, verbal, and mental conduct, who do not criticize the noble ones, have right view, and do deeds based on right view, get reborn in a good destination, in a heaven. That is how you see beings passing on and being reborn, understanding that they travel on according to their deeds.<a href="#fn281" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281" role="doc-noteref"><sup>281</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In another passage the Buddha talks about the possibility of going to heaven, asking his non-enlightened disciples to reflect: “I too have the kind of faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and understanding that those gods had, that resulted in their <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">passing on</span> from here and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">being reborn</span> there.”<a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282" role="doc-noteref"><sup>282</sup></a> In the definition of death at <a href="#bqseg20"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§20</span></a> he mentioned, “the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">passing on</span> of any kind of being from any order of beings—their passing away, deceasing, dying […]” Still elsewhere he said: “A being laid down their body and is not yet <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">reborn</span> in another body.”<a href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283" role="doc-noteref"><sup>283</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The terms ‘departing’ (<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">gati</span>) and ‘arriving’ (<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">āgati</span>)—also translated as ‘going’ and ‘coming’—are euphemisms for passing on and rebirth.<a href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284" role="doc-noteref"><sup>284</sup></a> When Anuruddha spoke of his divine sight, he said: “I see the passing on and rebirth of beings, their <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">departing</span> and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">arriving</span>, going from one state of existence to another.” In <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">The Great Lion’s Roar Discourse</span> the Buddha used the same ability to see renunciants (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samaṇas</span>) traveling to heavens and hells and said: “I know the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">departure</span> and <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">arrival</span>, the passing on and rebirth of those renunciants.” More down to earth, Paṭācārā talked about the death of her son, saying: “He passed away having a human body and will go on transmigrating. As he <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">arrived</span>, so he <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">departed</span>: why grieve over that?”<a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285" role="doc-noteref"><sup>285</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There are many similar instances of these words in the Canon, so there should be no question what the Seeds Discourse is about: the “departing or arriving of consciousness, its passing on or rebirth—its development, sprouting, or maturation” means rebirth.<a href="#fn286" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286" role="doc-noteref"><sup>286</sup></a> The last three terms might seem strange ways to refer to rebirth, but like ‘planting’ they are part of the simile in which consciousness is the seed for rebirth. Literal seeds that are buried in the earth and then given water are also said to develop, sprout, and mature.<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287" role="doc-noteref"><sup>287</sup></a> The three individual terms might refer to different stages of the rebirth process, like entering a womb, getting born, and growing up, but this is not clarified anywhere. They could also be synonyms.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In any event, it indicates that an earlier statement in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> also refers to rebirth: “Consciousness would continue to exist if it is attracted to form. Founded on form, planted in form, and sprinkled with enjoyment, it would develop, sprout, and mature [i.e. be reborn].” ‘Sprinkled with enjoyment’ is also part of the simile, because enjoyment is compared to water. The phrase ‘consciousness would continue to exist if it is attracted to form’ refers to the continuation of consciousness after death, because, as I argued earlier, the continuation of consciousness while one is alive does not depend on being attracted to something. The phrase is not grammatically intricate but has been translated rather cryptically by some translators, who either through over-literalism or not understanding the context speak of the “standing” of consciousness.<a href="#fn288" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288" role="doc-noteref"><sup>288</sup></a> But that ‘consciousness would continue to exist’ implies rebirth is also reflected in the following:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§78</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg78" class="anchor"></span>Mendicants, it would be better for your eyes to be lacerated by a searing, burning, glowing, red-hot iron nail, than for you to, because of its features, get caught up in the aspects of a sight you might see. I say this because I have seen the following problem. <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Consciousness would continue to exist</span> if it stays bound to the gratification in those aspects or features. And if you die at that time [when you’re caught up in sights], it is possible that it goes to one of two destinations: hell or the animal realm.<a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref289" role="doc-noteref"><sup>289</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the Seeds Discourse the four nutriments together with consciousness are compared to five seeds. Since one of the four nutriments is consciousness itself, it seems like it is included twice in the five seeds. However, this double inclusion represents the two different functions of the nutriment of consciousness: one is the desire for consciousness, the other is the stream of consciousness that continues from life to life. So the five seeds are:</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Desire for the five senses (the nutriment of edible food)</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Desire for sensations (the nutriment of sense impressions)</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Willful actions that lead to rebirth (the nutriment of intentions)</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Desire for existence (the nutriment of consciousness in one sense)</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The stream of consciousness (the nutriment of consciousness in the second sense)</p>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Although there are five metaphorical seeds, their result is of course only one rebirth, not five. In a sense, the first four seeds just assist the fifth. This is why in <a href="#figure18"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">figure 18</span></a> I drew one big seed surrounded by four smaller ones.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To return to my main point, there are many indications the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> is about rebirth: the similarity with the exchange with Ānanda on the seeds for existence (<a href="#bqseg71"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§71</span></a>); the words ‘departing’, ‘arriving’, ‘passing on’, and ‘rebirth’; the phrase ‘consciousness would continue to exist’; and the four nutriments that assist beings to be reborn. I clarified this in detail, because this central point is sometimes overlooked, and as a result the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> is also misunderstood. What this refers to, is explained next.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Not-planting-the-seed'>Not planting the seed</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> compares the four aspects of existence (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>) to the earth. This tells us that, just like a seed cannot grow if it is not planted in the ground, consciousness cannot continue to exist without any other aspect of existence. The discourse therefore also calls these four aspects of existence ‘the four supports for consciousness’. Consciousness is especially closely connected to sensation and perception. The three cannot be separated from one another (see <a href="#bqseg99"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§99</span></a>), so the desire for any type of sensation or perception is always accompanied by a desire for consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Since consciousness is intrinsically connected to the other four aspects of existence, if desire for them is abandoned, consciousness gets abandoned too. The figurative seed of rebirth then cannot sprout again. As the discourse says: “If you have abandoned desire for the elements of form, sensation, perception, and will, there will be no support for the planting of consciousness, because when desire is abandoned, its foundation is destroyed. Not planted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span>), consciousness will not sprout [i.e. be reborn].” See also the following illustration:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-figure">

Figure 19. Not planting consciousness as a simile for the end of rebirth</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>So the suggestion that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> is an unestablished consciousness separate from and uninfluenced by the aspects of existence, does not seem valid. The point is the exact opposite. The Buddha taught that consciousness cannot exist without the other aspects of existence, that it always depends on something, always is “established” somewhere.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Other-botanical-similes-for-rebirth'>Other botanical similes for rebirth</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There are still more discourses that connect seeds to rebirth, like some that call noble ones who will be reborn only once more ‘one-seeders’.<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290" role="doc-noteref"><sup>290</sup></a> But I want to introduce instead three discourses that use other botanical similes for rebirth, for they are more helpful in explaining the principles of Dependent Arising.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The first discourse depicts the continuation of existence as a sapling that is being kept alive. It begins with ‘focusing on the gratification of things that can chain’ (or ‘that can fetter’), which means perceiving things as pleasant which are actually suffering: a major aspect of ignorance. This ignorance gives rise to craving, after which the usual factors of the craving sequence follow.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§79</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg79" class="anchor"></span>Mendicants, for those who live focusing on the gratification of things that can chain them, craving increases. Dependent on craving, there is fuel [for rebirth]. Dependent on fuel, existence. Dependent on existence, birth. And dependent on birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Imagine a sapling. From time to time a man would clear the area around it and give it fresh soil and water. With that nutriment, with that fuel, that sapling would develop, sprout, and mature. Likewise, for those who live focusing on the gratification of things that can chain them, craving increases. Dependent on craving, there is fuel. Dependent on fuel, existence. Dependent on existence, birth. And dependent on birth, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress come to be. That is how this whole mass of suffering originates.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>For those who live focusing on the problems with things that can chain them, craving ceases. If craving ceases, fuel will cease. If fuel ceases, existence will cease. If existence ceases, birth will cease. And if birth ceases, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress, will cease. That is how this whole mass of suffering ceases.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Imagine a sapling. A man would come along carrying a spade and basket. He would cut off the sapling at its roots and then dig up and pull out the roots, even the small roots and the root fibers. He would cut the entire stalk into pieces, split the pieces, and break them into splinters. He would dry those in the sun and wind and then burn them in a fire, turning them into ashes. He would let the ashes get blown away by a strong wind or get carried away by a swift river. In that way the sapling would be cut off at its roots, made like a palm stump, put to an end, so that it would not rearise in the future. Likewise, for those who live focusing on the problems with things that can chain them, craving ceases. If craving ceases, fuel will cease. If fuel ceases, existence will cease. If existence ceases, birth will cease. And if birth ceases, old age and death, and sorrow, grief, pain, sadness, and distress, will cease.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The life of the plant is a metaphor for the existence of the being. A plant can only stay alive if it is given water. Likewise, existence can only continue in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> as long as there is craving. But when the problems with existence are understood, craving will cease, and there will be no more fuel for the continuance of existence after death.</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The word for ‘fuel’ is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span>, which earlier I translated with the two terms ‘fuel/taking up’. Often both meanings are implied, but in this discourse ‘fuel’ is the primary meaning, since it reoccurs in the metaphor in which the water and soil are called fuel (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span>) for the plant. This stands for craving, which acts as the fuel for rebirth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The metaphor of fuel is more famously applied to fires, but the Buddha also used it with reference to plants, as we see here. This is one reason I translate the verbal meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span> as ‘taking up’ instead of the more common ‘clinging’ or ‘grasping’, which I think are slightly inaccurate.<a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292" role="doc-noteref"><sup>292</sup></a> Plants are also said to ‘take up’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādiyati</span>) nutrients from the soil.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293" role="doc-noteref"><sup>293</sup></a> They don’t ‘cling to’ or ‘grasp’ such nutriments. So when the Buddha instructs his followers to stop <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">upādāna</span>, one implication is that we should no longer <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">take up</span> the five aspects of existence through craving, especially not at the end of life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The next text illustrates this concept more explicitly. It describes a tree that draws up (or takes up) sap through its roots. The life of the tree stands for the continuation of existence, just like the life of the sapling in the previous discourse.</p>

<p>This discourse contains the saying, “there will be no conception of consciousness. If consciousness ceases”, hence ‘no conception of consciousness’ implies the cessation of consciousness. The cessation of consciousness happens when an enlightened being passes away. Therefore, the opposite statement, ‘there will be a conception of consciousness’, must refer to the time of rebirth. Along similar lines of reasoning, the conception of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in the previous discourse also refers to rebirth, which is relevant to our primary text, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>, because it contains the same phrase.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If we compare the three suttas in this section, we can also confirm that the two parallel sequences in the full twelve-factored sequence describe rebirth, because we see that the conception of consciousness and the conception of the immaterial aspects and body are alternative ways to describe the creation of another existence and birth. Put schematically:</p>

<p>To repeat the main points of this chapter, the similes of the seeds and plants visualize the continuation of existence through rebirth. The planting (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭhita</span>) of the seed of consciousness stands for taking rebirth in a certain place, and it not being planted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span>) means not being reborn. Similarly, the conception of consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the start of a life, and when they are not conceived again, it means they will both cease.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> explained that it is impossible for consciousness to be reborn without other aspects of existence, which are metaphorically called the earth in which the seed of consciousness is planted. The next passage phrases the same idea differently, with these four aspects of existence being ‘shelters’ for consciousness:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§82</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The element of form is a shelter for consciousness. If, by desiring it, your consciousness is bound to the element of form, you are called ‘a migrant going from shelter to shelter’. The elements of sensation … perception … will is a shelter for consciousness. If, by desiring it, your consciousness is bound to the element of will, you are called ‘a migrant going from shelter to shelter’.<a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref297" role="doc-noteref"><sup>297</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Truth­finder (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tathāgata</span>) is then said to be without a shelter. Without any desire for the aspects of existence they “cut them at the roots, made them like a palm stump, so that they will not rearise in the future”, which means the aspect of existence won’t reoccur in a next life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Wijesekara already concluded that in this passage consciousness is “the surviving factor of an individual [which produces] repeated births resulting in what is generally known as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.”<a href="#fn298" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298" role="doc-noteref"><sup>298</sup></a> But he does not note that the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sārin</span> (migrant) comes from the same root as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span> (transmigration), and therefore also implies rebirth. In the Seeds Discourse, consciousness was said to continue in a next life if it is attracted to the other four aspects of existence; here it is said to migrate if it is bound to them by desire. It is the same principle in different words.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Both the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> and this passage also uniquely call the aspects of existence ‘elements’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātus</span>), which may also show a close connection between the two texts. They both tell us that there is no possibility of consciousness continuing in isolation, without any other aspects accompanying it. Whenever there is awareness, it is always aware of something and always depends on the sense faculties. There are no realms or places where this does not apply. Wherever consciousness is reborn, it is always along with other aspects of existence.</p>

<p>In some discourses on Dependent Arising, consciousness is said to be dependent not on the other four aspects of existence but on the immaterial aspects and body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>), which then effectively stand for these aspects of existence. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">City Discourse</span> is one example:</p>

This is a clear indication that the dependency between consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> concerns the process of rebirth and the life that results from it, not momentary states of mind or processes of recognition, as some have suggested.<a href="#fn301" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref301" role="doc-noteref"><sup>301</sup></a></p>

<p>The Sarvāstivāda and Dharmaguptaka parallels to this passage in the Āgamas differ in some ways, but convey the same basic ideas.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Because there can be no sentient existence without consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, they are the extent to which there is birth and death, “the extent to which the cycle of rebirth continues so life here (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">itthatta</span>) manifests”.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Putting their questionable authenticity aside, the statements on the limited extent of language and understanding can be understood once we recognize that without consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> there simply is no existence at all. Outside of them there is only the cessation of existence, also known as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span> (full extinguishment). With this in mind, I think there are two possible interpretations of statement <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">a</span>, on there being no way for language without consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The first option takes what we could call a third-person perspective on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>, looking at it from the point of view of a person who has <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">not</span> attained it. It argues that after the full extinguishment of someone else (or of oneself projected into the future) there is no longer anything to be named or described.<a href="#fn311" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref311" role="doc-noteref"><sup>311</sup></a> Even negations can be misconstrued. As Venerable Ajahn Brahm wrote, “it is a problem with language that when we describe what a thing is not, what qualities are absent, then the negation or the absence can easily be misunderstood as a thing in itself”.<a href="#fn312" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref312" role="doc-noteref"><sup>312</sup></a> This is certainly true in general. However, throughout the discourses the Buddha does describe <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span> in various ways—the cessation of consciousness along with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> being in fact one of these ways—so clearly it is not fully indescribable.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The second option, the one I prefer, takes more of a first-person perspective. It argues that without consciousness and the immaterial aspects and body there is no way for language, simply because there is no longer anybody or anything left to <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">use</span> language. In other words, after the cessation of consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> there is no descriptive activity anymore. Bhikkhu Bodhi seems to understand the statement in the same way: “It is in the mental body that designations, linguistic expressions, and descriptions take shape.”<a href="#fn313" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref313" role="doc-noteref"><sup>313</sup></a> Without such a mental body (or ‘immaterial aspects’) there is no longer a way to use language.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The veracity of this interpretation is backed up by statement <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">b</span>, on there being no understanding (or ‘wisdom’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paññā</span>) outside of consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. We can’t take the third-person perspective here. That is to say, this can't mean that understanding only reaches as far as consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> go, because what lies beyond them—i.e. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>—can also be understood. In this case it must mean that after the cessation of consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> there is no understanding anymore, simply because there is nothing left to <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">have</span> the understanding. Put differently, when the enlightened being passes away, their mental faculty to understand things passes away as well. Understanding only exists as long as consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> exist. This is supported by <a href="#bqseg92"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§92</span></a>, where it is said that understanding ceases when consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> cease. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Cūḷaniddesa</span> comments on this: “When the enlightened one is fully extinguished by the kind of extinguishment which leaves no remnant (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anupādisesa nibbānadhātu</span>), with the cessation of their final consciousness, understanding and the immaterial aspects and body cease too.”<a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314" role="doc-noteref"><sup>314</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This interpretation might not have the intricate implications others have derived from these terse and, frankly, rather unexplanatory statements on the extent of language and understanding.<a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref315" role="doc-noteref"><sup>315</sup></a> But a fundamental principle in textual analysis is to interpret the doubtful and rare in light of the clear and common. This interpretation does so, as it aligns with the more transparent and frequent statement that consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> are the extent to which beings can exist, and with the passage on the womb which contains these statements, where <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the being, not to concepts or cognitive processes. The idea is simple: life, including language and understanding, only exists as long as there is consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. When consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> cease, these things can no longer be.<a href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316" role="doc-noteref"><sup>316</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>With those two statements addressed, hopefully to some satisfaction, we can consider the actual dependencies between consciousness and individual’s immaterial aspects and body.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The same concepts were also expressed in the passage on consciousness migrating from shelter to shelter. All these texts tell us that consciousness depends on other things.

In the words of Hamilton, “the mutual dependence of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> […] is established in order to prevent independent existence being ascribed to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>.”<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319" role="doc-noteref"><sup>319</sup></a> This is why consciousness together with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is the extent to which there is existence, “the extent to which the cycle of rebirth continues so life here manifests”.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> explains the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">origination</span> of consciousness along with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, which refers specifically to birth. This should be kept in mind when contemplating the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">origination</span> sequence of Dependent Arising. However, the mutual dependency between consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> continues after birth as well. Venerable Bodhi stated: “Consciousness requires mentality-materiality [<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>] not only at conception, but all throughout life. It depends on a vital functioning body with its brain, nervous system, and sense faculties. It also depends on the mental body [i.e. immaterial aspects], as there can be no cognition of an object without the more specialized functions performed by contact, sensation, perception, volition, attention, and the rest.”<a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref320" role="doc-noteref"><sup>320</sup></a> Langer likewise concluded: “An obvious explanation for the dependence of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is that—at least in the sensual realm—the process of consciousness takes place with the sense organs as its basis […] and therefore a functioning <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> […] requires a body.”<a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321" role="doc-noteref"><sup>321</sup></a> In simple terms, for consciousness to be reborn and continue to function, there needs to be other stuff, there need to be ‘immaterial aspects and body’.</p>

<p>This might all sound very abstract, but some discourses ask the meditator to reflect on this as follows:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reflection is done after the meditator emerges from the deep meditative states called jhānas. In the jhānas you have looked at the mind directly, vividly seeing it function separately from the five bodily senses. It is like going to different universe, the universe of the mind. If you reflect on this experience even briefly, it will be difficult if not impossible for you to still hold a materialistic view of life. You realize the mind is non-material and can survive after death. However, in this life it is bound to this particular body, like the gem is tied to a particular color string.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This realization, even though it can be life changing, in the discourses is only the first and lowest of a series, so it is still far from a full insight into the conditioned existence of consciousness. But it is a significant way in which the dependency of consciousness on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> has pragmatic relevance even before deeper insight develops. It is a start to directly seeing the mechanisms of rebirth and therefore Dependent Arising.</p>

<p>So, consciousness depends on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> throughout life. However, in the origination sequence, which describes its <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">arising</span>, the terms refer specifically to rebirth, which is why the Buddha explains the dependency by describing the conception of a fetus in a womb. The cessation sequence accordingly refers to the end of life:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Before addressing the other dependency—depencency 1, that of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> on consciousness—it will be helpful to consider the historical context of these teachings. As said before, the Buddha did not teach in a social vacuum. Most if not all of his teachings are dialectical, which means they were formed as a reply to others. When the Buddha said consciousness depends on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, this was also dialectical. He was specifically addressing Brahmanic beliefs, because some Brahmins thought that by shedding their “name and form” at death they could merge with a kind of universal objectless consciousness. This has been pointed out by various scholars of Buddhism,<a href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325" role="doc-noteref"><sup>325</sup></a> and was summarized by Venerable Sujato as follows:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The terminology of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was adopted by the Buddha from the pre-Buddhist Upaniṣadic philosophy. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the limited and diverse ‘names’ and ‘shapes’ in the world, each of which has its own identity, like a river; but for the enlightened [Brahmin] they flow and merge together into infinite consciousness, like the great ocean. In stating that consciousness was itself dependent on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, the Buddha was turning this Upaniṣadic idea on its head. Consciousness is not an independent metaphysical absolute, but a part of everyday empirical reality, as fragile and dependent as anything else.<a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326" role="doc-noteref"><sup>326</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In other words, Brahmins believed that their name and form separated them from a universal nameless and shapeless existence. Abandoning these aspects of one’s being was thought to bring the Brahmin to an everlasting state of unity with a sort of infinite consciousness. This happened at death but was prepared for in life by gaining knowledge about the process beforehand. In the book <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Nāma-rūpa and Dharma-rūpa</span>, Maryla Falk explained that the process was believed to happen in two steps. First one’s form, one’s body, was abandoned, thereafter one’s name:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>The first part of the process […] follow[s] the dissolution of the organic frame [i.e. the death of the body] whose functions [e.g. awareness] are now unified with the vijñānamaya ātma [the self made of consciousness]. The second part of this process of mukta [liberation] goes beyond this sphere of rūpaless unity […] and abuts in the sphere of the transcendent Purusa [the heavenly Person] the attainment of the transcendent sphere […] the utter abandonment of both rūpa and nāma.<a href="#fn327" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327" role="doc-noteref"><sup>327</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Unlike Buddhism, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span> were not the creation of a single person but of various spiritual leaders, who did not always have the exact same ideas.<a href="#fn328" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328" role="doc-noteref"><sup>328</sup></a> As a result this process of liberation may be detailed variously throughout the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>. Not all Brahmins aimed for the absolution of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> either. Many pursued more worldly aims or still the older Vedic goal of an eternal afterlife amongst one’s forefathers. But the ultimate goal of at least <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">some</span> Brahmins was to release themselves from “name and form” so that only pure consciousness remained, in an everlasting state of unity with the heavenly “Person”, also known as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">brahman</span>, ‘the supreme’. (The word ‘Person’ is symbolic. It was by these Brahmins not regarded as a real person or even personal god, but more like the source of consciousness itself.) It was these heterodox Brahmins the Buddha was primarily addressing when explaining that consciousness always depends on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.</p>

It could be that the abandoning of such concepts is also implied in these passages, but in the last passage the idea is abandoning one’s personal name and form, since it talks about beings no longer identifying with their own names, like ‘tiger’ or ‘wolf’ (or ‘Sue’ or ‘Harry’). This passage is also the only one coming from what is generally accepted to be a pre-Buddhist <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣad</span>, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Chāndogya</span>.

<p>This statement, which reflects the standard eternalist belief in the Canon, directly refutes Brahmanical ideas about a universal self. With the dependency of consciousness on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> the Buddha was also addressing such ideas. While Brahmins believed that the abandonment of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> would result in a state of transcendent consciousness, the Buddha taught that consciousness is intrinsically dependent on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>, so that their abandonment results in the cessation of consciousness. Existence is always a combination of consciousness <span data-custom-style="Strong">and</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.

In the story, which I take to be symbolic, an unnamed monk travels to Brahmā to ask him how to get liberated from earth, water, fire, and air, which represent form. Brahmā doesn’t know and sends the monk to the Buddha. The story intends to illustrate, among other things, that the Buddha’s teachings surpass those of the Brahmins.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the story the Buddha speaks the following verses to the monk:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To summarize the conclusions of my earlier essay, these verses contain two separate questions and answers. The first answer describes a state of consciousness where the four elements (i.e. form) cannot infiltrate or “find no footing”. This is the state of unbounded consciousness, the second formless attainment. (In this context form goes beyond the body and also includes a mental perception of “bounded” space.)<a href="#fn341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341" role="doc-noteref"><sup>341</sup></a> The second answer describes the cessation of all consciousness, including unbounded consciousness, at which time <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> ceases too.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Richard Gombrich already observed that “the opening statement of the answer seems <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">prima facie</span> to reify consciousness and the language sounds as if it could come from an <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣad</span>”.<a href="#fn342" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342" role="doc-noteref"><sup>342</sup></a> He did not provide further sources, but I have no doubt these verses indeed reference Brahmanic ideas. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</span>, the Brahmin sage Yājñavalkya describes the highest form of existence as “an unbounded, limitless mass of consciousness” and also calls it “neither fine nor coarse, neither long nor short”, in both cases using the direct Sanskrit equivalents of the terms used in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>.<a href="#fn343" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343" role="doc-noteref"><sup>343</sup></a> He also describes this form of existence as being different from, and uninfluenced by, the four elements.<a href="#fn344" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344" role="doc-noteref"><sup>344</sup></a> Further, the Taittirīya Upaniṣad calls this highest essence “invisible”, i.e., without appearance.<a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref345" role="doc-noteref"><sup>345</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is a bit more speculative, but the term ‘all-shining’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabbato pabhaṁ</span>) might have a link with a statement from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Chāndogya Upaniṣad</span>: “Far above here [is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">brahman</span>] the light that shines from heaven on the backs of everything, on the backs of all (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabba</span>) things, in the very highest of the high worlds—it is clearly this very same light here within a man.

<p>Yājñavalkya’s unbounded consciousness likely differed from the Buddha’s, not only philosophically but also in practice, because the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span> seem to indicate Yājñavalkya arrived at it through reason rather than meditation.<a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref348" role="doc-noteref"><sup>348</sup></a> But regardless, the Buddha did use the exact same terminology, which indicates he (or whoever composed the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>) was very familiar with these Brahmanic ideas and was addressing them directly.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Before I explain exactly how the Buddha responded to these ideas, it is worth noting that although Brahmins called the highest goal a self (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ātman</span>), this did not mean that the person continued forever as a separate individual, a personal self. The term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ātman</span> had several senses. Any type of essence of the being was called a ‘self’. The goal was an impersonal attainment, the ultimate conscious state of existence. Karel Werner wrote: “There is no trace of the individual in it, even though [it] is an individual experience accessible at the moment of its duration just to that one particular person.”<a href="#fn349" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref349" role="doc-noteref"><sup>349</sup></a> Yājñavalkya himself said: “It is to be seen by the mind alone that nothing exists separately here. […] It is to be seen as just oneness, immeasurable and constant. The self is stainless, beyond space, unborn, immense, constant.”<a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350" role="doc-noteref"><sup>350</sup></a> This supposed eternal, unborn, immeasurable experience, although called a self, therefore was also in a sense self-less. That is exactly why in order to attain it, one’s personal name and form had to be abandoned, leaving only unbounded consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Gombrich also commented on the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span> that “it is a bit risky to take a riddle or its solution as a philosophical tenet or argument”.<a href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351" role="doc-noteref"><sup>351</sup></a> I wholeheartedly embrace this sentiment in general, but in this particular case the overall meaning seems clear enough to me. My interpretation of these verses is also a safe one, for rather than taking them as a unique statement on the nature of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbāna</span>, it aligns with the Buddha’s overall teachings. In short, he acknowledged the existence of an unbounded consciousness but denied its unconditioned nature. To the Buddha all consciousness is dependently arisen, including unbounded consciousness. His actual response to the Brahmanic ideas is therefore two final lines of verse: “when consciousness ceases, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">then</span> those come to cease”. While Yājñavalkya’s goal was a type of consciousness free from name and form, his goal was the cessation of consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>However, some suggest the Buddha’s final goal was <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">also</span> a state of unbounded consciousness, and these verses are often taken as primary evidence for that. As I discussed in the essay, this is a consequence of interpreting the two answer verses as a single answer instead of two separate ones. I actually suspect this was intended to happen, to a certain extent. That is because, as Gombrich noticed, the verses seem like they’re right in line with Brahmanic beliefs… but only until the final two lines are added! If we remove those lines, we get: “Unbounded consciousness, without appearance, all-shining: here earth, water, fire, and air find no footing. Here the long and short, the fine and coarse, the fair and ugly, here the immaterial aspects and body fully come to cease.” This sounds exactly like Yājñavalkya’s neither-fine-nor-coarse, neither-long nor-short unbounded mass of consciousness which is untouched by the four elements. However! The addition of “when consciousness ceases, then those come to cease”, completely changes the meaning of the verses. They now have to be read as two different answers, in the way I suggested. It’s like the Buddha said, “I got something… stolen from me.” The meaning is only revealed at the end, and it turns the goal from a presence of something (an unbounded consciousness) into an absence.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To conclude this little detour into Brahmanic thought, it is important to keep in mind that the Buddha spoke to a certain audience. When we put his teachings into practice, they can sometimes feel so alive, it is easy to assume everything he said is timeless, as relevant today as ever. But while such a mindset may be inspiring for the practitioner, it is problematic when interpreting ancient texts. Although it is true that the deep truths the Buddha’s teachings point at have remained unchanged, the pointers themselves are sometimes a bit outdated. As a result some of the pragmatic implications of these teachings are lost on us. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nāmarūpa</span> is a good example. If the Buddha were to teach in our day and age, he would not speak about “name and form”, since most of us aren’t Brahmins aiming to leave our “name and form” behind to reach a state of unconditioned consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>What has remained very relevant, however, is the general idea that consciousness can’t exist in isolation, because some Buddhists believe the Buddha taught the highest goal to be some consciousness free from objects or content.<a href="#fn352" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352" role="doc-noteref"><sup>352</sup></a> But it was the Brahmins who did so, not the Buddha. The Buddha said all consciousness is dependently arisen. Or, as he chose to put it, consciousness depends on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-dependency-of-nāmarūpa-on-consciousness'>The dependency of nāmarūpa on consciousness</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Also connected to some ancient concepts, although to a lesser extent, is <span data-custom-style="Strong">dependency 1</span>, that of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> (the body and other individual aspects of a being) on consciousness. This dependency is part of the standard sequence of Dependent Arising, where it is phrased as: “Dependent on consciousness, there are the individual’s immaterial aspects and body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṁ</span>).” In isolation this statement is rather non-explanatory, so how should it be understood?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The passage of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> on conception in the womb (<a href="#bqseg84"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§84</span></a>) contains the most detailed explanation of this dependency in the Pāli Canon. Quite significantly, before giving this explanation the Buddha says: “I said the individual’s immaterial aspects and body depend on consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṁ</span>), which is to be understood <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">as follows</span>.” This indicates that whenever the phrase <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇapaccayā nāmarūpaṁ</span> occurs, such as in the standard sequence, it should be understood in line with the explanation given in the Mahānidāna Sutta. Since there is no other direct explanation of this dependency in the canon, this passage should not be lightly swept aside. It is not merely an example of the dependency of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> on consciousness,<a href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353" role="doc-noteref"><sup>353</sup></a> but the foremost explanation in the canon.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#chapter3"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Chapter 3</span></a> I showed that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> refers to the individual being, and in the last chapter I discussed the rebirth of consciousness. In this passage these two ideas come together. The Buddha describes the “entry” (or ‘conception’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">avakkanti</span>) of consciousness at the immaterial aspects and body inside the mother’s womb, mentioning various words already familiar to us: ‘produced’, ‘conception’, ‘consciousness is planted’, and even ‘develop, sprout, and mature’, which all refer to rebirth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The primary message is that a being is not born out of nowhere. It had a past life, a past consciousness. This consciousness (or spirit, we might say more freely) is what gets reborn in the new life and thereby becomes a conditioning factor for the rest of the individual. Without consciousness continuing on in such a way, if it were “cut off” in the womb, there can be no new life. This specifically refutes the materialistic understanding of life, the assumption that the being is just physical stuff, a view mentioned regularly in the canon as being wrong.<a href="#fn354" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354" role="doc-noteref"><sup>354</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>We find another pragmatic application of this link when we consider that consciousness itself depends on willful actions. We aren’t just “thrown” into the world, to use a Heideggerian term. We were born in this human life because our past will and intention drove us here. If we remain attached to the human realm—to our country, our families, our body, our five senses, and so on—then our will and intentions are likely to be directed towards another human life. Our consciousness will be reborn in a womb again.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Consciousness-as-the-carrier-of-life'>Consciousness as the carrier of life</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There is a little language barrier between Pāli and English here, for in English we do not use the word ‘consciousness’ to describe what gets reborn, and are more likely to use something like ‘spirit’ or ‘mind’ instead. We do not say things like “the rebirth of consciousness” or “consciousness is conceived in the womb”. In Pāli, however, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> has a wider meaning than just consciousness in the sense of awareness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>First of all, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> can also stand for the mind more generally. In some instances it is used as a direct synonym for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">mano</span>, both commonly translated as ‘mind’.<a href="#fn355" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355" role="doc-noteref"><sup>355</sup></a> It is also said that the consciousness of the unenlightened becomes preoccupied with change.<a href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356" role="doc-noteref"><sup>356</sup></a> In such instances consciousness stands for something more than the plain awareness it signifies as one of the five aspects of existence. It represents the whole mind, including its perceptions, thoughts, and sensations. In at least one passage, the Thai Pāli manuscripts even use <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> where other editions have <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>.<a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357" role="doc-noteref"><sup>357</sup></a> The Āgamas sometimes also use ‘mind’ (心) as a translation for what must in the original have been <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> or its Sanskrit equivalent <span data-custom-style="wwc-sanskrit">vijñāna</span>.<a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref358" role="doc-noteref"><sup>358</sup></a> Also deserving consideration is a discourse in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Satipaṭṭhāna Saṁyutta</span> where not <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> but <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> is said to depend on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>: “The mind (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>) originates from the immaterial aspects and body. The mind will disappear if the immaterial aspects and body cease.”<a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref359" role="doc-noteref"><sup>359</sup></a> The context here is a little different, but it is an alternative way to phrase the dependency of consciousness on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span> being a synonym for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Aside from referring to the mind in general, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> was also a name for the surviving aspect of the being, or as Venerable Anālayo describes it, “what provides the transition from one body to another”.<a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360" role="doc-noteref"><sup>360</sup></a> The suttas mention “the body with consciousness”, consciousness is said to be bound to the body as long as one is alive, and the person dies when consciousness (and vitality and heat) leave the body.<a href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361" role="doc-noteref"><sup>361</sup></a> It is also said that consciousness roams and transmigrates in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>; that it passes on and gets reborn; that it travels on after death; and, in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, that it enters the womb.<a href="#fn362" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362" role="doc-noteref"><sup>362</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The PTS Pāli-English Dictionary therefore glosses under <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>, before discussing more analytical meanings of the word: “the bearer of (individual) life, life-force (as extending also over rebirths), principle of conscious life, […] mind as transmigrant, […] In this (fundamental) application it may be characterized as the sensory and perceptive activity commonly expressed by ‘mind’. It is difficult to give any one word for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>, because there is much difference between the old Buddhist and our modern points of view, and there is a varying use of the term in the Canon itself.”<a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363" role="doc-noteref"><sup>363</sup></a> Many scholars have echoed these observations,<a href="#fn364" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364" role="doc-noteref"><sup>364</sup></a> and Kalupahana summarized: “At least three important uses of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> can be clearly distinguished. First, it is used to denote psychic phenomena in general, synonymous with the terms <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">citta</span>, ‘mind’, and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">mano</span>, ‘thought’. Second, it is used to describe a complete act of perception or cognition [i.e. instances of awareness]; and third, it stands for the connecting link between two lives.”<a href="#fn365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365" role="doc-noteref"><sup>365</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reason <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> was used to indicate what travels between lives, is that awareness seems to be a constant.<a href="#fn366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366" role="doc-noteref"><sup>366</sup></a> This subjective feeling of continuity made people think consciousness was permanent and would keep existing after death. The Buddha knew consciousness to be impermanent and ever-changing, but he did not shy away from using the term in a more conventional sense as well. Just like with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, he did not introduce the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> but adopted it from society, where it already had various meanings. After all, to get new ideas across you have to start with some shared terminology. “In order to make himself understood the Buddha had to talk in terms with which his audiences were already familiar,” wrote Gombrich.<a href="#fn367" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref367" role="doc-noteref"><sup>367</sup></a> In this case, the audience was already familiar with using <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> to refer to what survives death.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Thai nowadays also use <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> (วิญญาณ) to refer to the surviving spirit. The English word ‘consciousness’ ill fits such contexts,<a href="#fn368" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref368" role="doc-noteref"><sup>368</sup></a> and according to Schmithausen might even be considered misleading: “This <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> [of Dependent Arising] is somewhat misleadingly rendered as ‘Wahrnehmung’ [‘consciousness/awareness’], because it primarily concerns a subtle carrier of life.”<a href="#fn369" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref369" role="doc-noteref"><sup>369</sup></a> It might be unintuitive for a word to have multiple meanings which no single English term can encapsulate, but as long as we keep the language gap in mind, the essential ideas behind the factor of consciousness are clear enough. In the discourses it includes more than just moments of awareness, referring also to the mind or life-force that travels from one life to the next.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This meaning of consciousness applies not only to its links with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> but also to its link with willful actions. As Frauwallner stated: “Out of these passages we get the valuable information that knowledge [Frauwallner’s translation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>] in the oldest Buddhism is the essential bearer of the cycle of existence, which enters in the next embodiment after death […]. From these cited passages, the chain of causes is understood as follows: the impulses of the will (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṅkhāra</span>) as the cause of knowledge (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>) do <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">not</span> call forth knowledge itself [in the moment] but <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">only</span> bring about its entry into the mother’s womb.”<a href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370" role="doc-noteref"><sup>370</sup></a> In <a href="#bqseg55"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§55</span></a> &amp; <a href="#bqseg56"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§56</span></a> consciousness was said to travel on to a certain place after death depending on one’s willful actions. This rebirth of consciousness is what Frauwallner is talking about.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The same general principle also applies to the planting or establishing of consciousness in a certain realm. Hamilton wrote: “The individual life is sometimes expressed by stating that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> is ‘stationed’ [or ‘planted’]: the centrality of consciousness allows it to be used as a general metaphor for an entire life.”<a href="#fn371" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref371" role="doc-noteref"><sup>371</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The cessation sequence also confirms that the factor of consciousness concerns the entire life, not the arising of individual instances of consciousness. Otherwise enlightened beings, who have no more ignorance and resultant willful actions, would have lost all consciousness the moment they became enlightened. But consciousness instead only ceases when they pass away.<a href="#fn372" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref372" role="doc-noteref"><sup>372</sup></a> Therefore, the phrase “if willful actions cease, consciousness will cease” means that consciousness will cease <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">at death</span>, as a result of (ignorant) willful actions ceasing at an earlier time. By extent, in the origination sequence, the factor of consciousness also does not refer to the arising of instances of consciousness. It refers to the start of life, to the arising of the entire aspect of existence of consciousness.<a href="#fn373" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref373" role="doc-noteref"><sup>373</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>All that said, I think the commentaries get too technical when specifically calling the consciousness of Dependent Arising ‘linking consciousness’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paṭisandhi-viññāṇa</span>), by which they mean it links the past life to the new one.<a href="#fn374" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref374" role="doc-noteref"><sup>374</sup></a> The commentaries correctly understand that the factor of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> focuses on rebirth, but the Buddha phrased things more generally. Consciousness as a factor of Dependent Arising still refers to the aspect of existence of consciousness, which does not just link lives together but also continues to exist in the new life. The arising of consciousness as a result of willful actions is the general continuation of this aspect of existence into a next life, not a separate type of ‘linking consciousness’ that exists only for a moment or so.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In a similar spirit, although the suttas call the process that continues from life to life ‘consciousness’, this does not mean that consciousness exists without other aspects of existence at any point in time. Between lives consciousness still depends on other things, including some subtle form of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. However, such technical considerations about the in-between state are not what the standard sequence intends to convey, where the arising of consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> concerns their continuance into a new life.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Consciousness-as-a-stream'>Consciousness as a stream</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Using ‘consciousness’ to refer to the process that continues from life to life has a downside, however, because it can be mistaken to refer to some entity or self, like some Brahmins believed consciousness to be. The Brahmins used the term in similar ways as the Buddha, as the transmigrating aspect of the being, but to them it signified a permanent entity, while the Buddha understood consciousness to be an impermanent process. “There is no doubt that the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣadic</span> tradition took the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vijñāna</span> as the surviving factor at death in the metaphysical sense of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ātman</span> [self] that leaves the body at death”, wrote Wijesekera. “Thus it is easy to see how the Buddhist theory of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> as the surviving factor shows a distinct difference from the parallel Upaniṣadic concept.”<a href="#fn375" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref375" role="doc-noteref"><sup>375</sup></a> The difference being that the Buddhist <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> lacks any constancy or self.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is not strange the Brahmins had such absolutist ideas. As said earlier, for unenlightened beings there is this <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">sense</span> of sameness, this watcher or knower people feel is behind all of their experiences. That very sameness is what the Brahmins also felt. They concluded this consciousness was indestructible and would continue unchanged after death. They (or more likely society at large) were already using the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> in this sense before the Buddha appeared on the scene. He then challenged these preexisting ideas in various ways but without completely changing the terminology.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Here is an example from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg94" class="anchor"></span>What is that self? It is this person—the one that consists of consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vijñāna</span>) among the vital functions, the one that is the inner light within the heart.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving</span>, a monk named Sāti has such a view. “It is this unchanging consciousness that roams and transmigrates”, he claims. “It is he [i.e. the person/self] who speaks, he who feels, who in various realms experiences the results of good and bad deeds.”<a href="#fn377" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref377" role="doc-noteref"><sup>377</sup></a> The Buddha rebukes Sāti, saying consciousness is not an unchanging entity. It is inconstant and fluctuating, with its contents depending on changing objects of awareness. As Vetter explained:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Perception [Vetter’s translation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>] was thought of as transmigrating (perhaps accompanied by faint feeling, apperception and emotions). This perception was seen as a kind of substance, though not (or, no longer) as unchanging [by the Buddha]. This is a relic of an ancient idea that ‘perception’, as the subtlest part of a person, is the transmigratory entity. […] But we must be cautious. This part of the twelvefold chain, though showing traces of old ideas, probably presupposes discriminating insight at a stage where ‘perception’ was considered transient as well. In this sense the monk Sāti is rightly criticized […] for stating that it is always this same ‘perception’ which transmigrates.<a href="#fn378" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref378" role="doc-noteref"><sup>378</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Buddha tells Sāti that consciousness occurs dependent on the objects of the six senses, describing the arising of different types of consciousness depending on sense impressions. (This is a different concept from consciousness arising dependent on willful actions, as the next chapter illustrates.) The Buddha effectively tells Sāti that consciousness is not a constant entity but an ever-changing stream of unique instances that succeed one another.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sampasādanīya Sutta</span>, although the passage is abstract and lacks context, Sāriputta indeed mentions a stream of consciousness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇasota</span>) that can be planted in this world or another world.<a href="#fn379" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref379" role="doc-noteref"><sup>379</sup></a> The analogy with a stream is apt, because as Heraclitus’ famous saying goes, you can’t step in the same river twice.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This important principle—that there is no constancy or self in consciousness, yet it still transmigrates—has sometimes been misunderstood by writers challenging the multiple-lifetime interpretation of Dependent Arising.

Streams of water are ever-changing, but we can still use the word ‘stream’ to point to this impermanent phenomena. Likewise, we can use the term ‘consciousness’ without implying a self. Notice also that the Buddha actually didn’t challenge Sāti’s statement that consciousness transmigrates. He only challenged it being a stable entity.<a href="#fn383" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref383" role="doc-noteref"><sup>383</sup></a> As already observed by the PTS Pāli-English Dictionary more than a century ago: “It was [by Sāti] also held to be an immutable, persistent substance, a view strongly condemned [by the Buddha]. Since, however, the persistence of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> from life to life is declared […], we must judge that it is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">only</span> the immutable persistence that is condemned.”<a href="#fn384" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref384" role="doc-noteref"><sup>384</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>We can assume the Brahmanic idea of an unchanging transmigrating consciousness was quite prevalent in the Buddha’s days, given that even a Buddhist monk believed in it. Sāti even thought it was the Buddha’s own teaching! For this reason I think the Buddha’s definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> as the six types of consciousness (<a href="#bqseg2"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§2</span></a>) was largely a teaching on the absence of a self. It told the audience that consciousness, although it does continue from life to life, is not a fixed entity. It consists of six different types of consciousness. This makes the definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> similar in function to the definitions of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span>. Rather than being a technical explanation of the word, it was meant to challenge existing notions about what a person is. As Olalde summarized: “[The Buddha’s] reinterpretation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> mirrors that of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>, in which the older notion of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> as a transmigrating entity was eventually replaced by the sixfold [consciousness].”<a href="#fn385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref385" role="doc-noteref"><sup>385</sup></a> The Buddha’s definitions of ‘consciousness’ and ‘the immaterial aspects and body’ together imply that the whole being is without any fixed essence. In short: one’s “name” is the result of a collection of mental processes, one’s body is an experience of “form” made of the four elements, and one’s consciousness is an ever-changing stream of events. None of these contains an essence or self.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The exchange between these venerable monks may benefit from some clarification. To start, it is interesting to note that according to the Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names, Koṭṭhita was also born a Brahmin, just like Sāriputta.<a href="#fn387" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref387" role="doc-noteref"><sup>387</sup></a> So again these teachings on consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> may be addressing Brahmin views. The terms ‘made by oneself’ and ‘made by another’ to Brahmins would have meant made by the person’s own self or by higher powers in the universe, like a creator god or <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">brahman</span>.<a href="#fn388" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref388" role="doc-noteref"><sup>388</sup></a> Sāriputta explains that no self or higher power underlies consciousness or the immaterial aspects and body.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The imagery was probably derived from farmers drying bundles of hay in a field. Just like the simile of the seed, it was something people could link directly to their experience of the world. The simile has its limits, though, because if you pull away one physical bundle of reeds, the other will fall to the ground, but it will still exist.

<p>In the following illustration I added the mutual dependency to the tower of bricks. This reminds us that consciousness and the individual’s immaterial aspects &amp; body rely not just on one another but also on willful actions. That is also why Sāriputta said these factors do not arise at random. Although there is no self, where the being is reborn is not random, because it is still determined by actions and intentions.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The dependency of the immaterial aspects and body on consciousness is not just an absolute dependency but also a conditioning dependency. By this I mean, consciousness does not just underlie the mere existence of the immaterial aspects and body; it also shapes them. The being’s willful actions determine where their consciousness takes rebirth, which in turn determines the quality of their immaterial aspects and body.</p>

<p>It is not unusual for verses to leave some things open to interpretation. In this case neither the brahmin nor the Buddha explicitly explains what it means to be entangled in the inside and outside. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Visuddhimagga</span> has a somewhat uninspired take on this, thinking it refers to craving for things of one’s own and things of others. I suggest something a bit more poetic. The inner tangle is indeed the defilements in the mind including craving, but the external tangle refers to existence, to being stuck in the “external” world. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> refers to this, saying people are entangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, being stuck in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.<a href="#fn395" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref395" role="doc-noteref"><sup>395</sup></a> There are two different tangles, then, but since they are closely connected, the rest of the discourse refers to them just as ‘the tangle’.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Bhāradvāja only asks who <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">can</span> untangle the tangle. This question is already answered in the Buddha’s first verse, but he then adds two more.

The trainee <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">can</span> untangle the tangle, but the enlightened one <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">has</span> untangled it.

<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">The individual’s immaterial aspects and body depend on consciousness.</span> This means there is no birth of an individual without a consciousness coming from a previous life. It reinforces the concept of rebirth and is a negation of materialism. The stream of consciousness travels wherever the willful actions direct it, and the being’s immaterial aspects and body are shaped accordingly, for example like a human or animal. The link also implies that existence, and therefore suffering, can only cease with the cessation of consciousness.</p>

<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="Strong">Consciousness depends on the individual’s immaterial aspects and body.</span> This means consciousness can’t continue to exist without other aspects of the being.

<h1 id='CHAPTER-9.-The-dual-nature-of-consciousness'><span id='chapter9' class='anchor'></span>9. The dual nature of consciousness</h1>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This book focuses on consciousness as the third factor in the standard sequence of Dependent Arising, and I hope to have shown that in this context ‘consciousness’ refers to the general existence of the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">whole</span> aspect of existence of consciousness. The arising of consciousness as a result of willful actions means rebirth in a certain place, and its cessation happens when the enlightened one passes away. But the suttas also speak of the arising and ceasing of instances of consciousness <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">within</span> this aspect of existence. This so-called momentary arising of consciousness forms the subject of this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>A little point on linguistics before we start. Some authors suggest the aspect of existence of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> to be a separative or divisive knowing, opposing it to a supposed unified or undivided knowing experienced by enlightened beings (although they contradict their own arguments when saying that this type of knowing is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">also</span> called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>).<a href="#fn401" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref401" role="doc-noteref"><sup>401</sup></a> Their argument is based on etymology, taking the prefix <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vi</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">-</span> to indicate separation or division. But firstly, as Venerable Sujato already responded to such views, this is not the only use of the prefix.<a href="#fn402" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref402" role="doc-noteref"><sup>402</sup></a> The word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">visuddhi</span> for example, literally means ‘very pure’, not ‘divided pure’, although it is more fitting to regard the prefix as effectively meaningless here. In <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> the prefix likewise has no distinct meaning. Secondly, ‘divided knowing’ does not fit the use of the word in various texts, including the non-Buddhist. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Upaniṣads</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vijñāna</span> is used for the awareness Brahmins believed to experience when they were unified with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">brahman</span>, and in the suttas a state of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> (unification) is called ‘unbounded <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>’. In this state consciousness still depends on an object, but the sense is that of unity, not division. And lastly but most importantly, deriving the meaning of a word by its prefix is generally bad linguistics. Bhikkhu Bodhi wrote in his book on Pāli that “one cannot deduce the meaning of a verb simply by adding the nuance of the prefix to the meaning of the basic verb”, and with this he in fact referred specifically to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span>.<a href="#fn403" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref403" role="doc-noteref"><sup>403</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The discriminative part of cognition is generally called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saññā</span> instead, although the term has some more nuanced meanings too. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Viññāṇa</span> as an aspect of existence is just the basic knowing, the uninterpreted awareness of things—what in modern discourse might be called phenomenal consciousness.<a href="#fn404" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref404" role="doc-noteref"><sup>404</sup></a> As we have seen, the word is used in some different ways as well, but they generally relate to this basic meaning, not to ‘divided knowing’.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>By the chapter title, ‘the dual nature of consciousness’, I therefore do not mean the kind of divided or discriminative knowing proposed by others. I instead use this terminology to indicate consciousness is always consciousness <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">of</span> something, that it always depends on an object. There isn’t any type of consciousness free from this conditioning.

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Two-different-uses-of-‘the-arising-of-consciousness’'>Two different uses of ‘the arising of consciousness’</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As I pointed out in the very first chapter, the aspect of existence of consciousness is a collection of different types of consciousness. To abbreviate the definition of <a href="#bqseg2"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§2</span></a>: “Sight-‍, hearing-‍, smell-‍, taste-‍, touch-‍, and mind-consciousness: that is what’s called consciousness.” In context of the default sequence of Dependent Arising, Schmithausen thought the factor of consciousness is “not so much an act of consciousness but rather the [whole] <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">faculty</span> of consciousness”.<a href="#fn406" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref406" role="doc-noteref"><sup>406</sup></a> This use has to be kept separate from the arising of the individual instances (or “acts”) of consciousness within that faculty. The arising of instances of consciousness is not the outcome of willful actions but the result of sense impressions.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The difference between the two uses will become very apparent in <a href="#bqseg108"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§108</span></a>, where the Buddha says enlightened beings still experience the arising of consciousness due to sense impressions, but they have no ignorance, so no longer perform willful actions that lead to rebirth. The aggregate of consciousness will therefore not arise again in another birth. In other words, the link between willful actions and consciousness is destroyed, but the link between sense impressions and individual instances of consciousness still exists. Instances of consciousness still arise, but the aggregate of consciousness won’t re-arise in a next life.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>A simile adopted from Venerable Ajahn Brahm may clarify matters.<a href="#fn407" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref407" role="doc-noteref"><sup>407</sup></a> A man moves into a new house and puts a new television on his wall. During the years spent in the house he watches six different channels on the television. He is only able to do this because he bought the television the day he moved in. The house stands for a next life, the television for the origination of the whole aggregate of consciousness. The six channels represent the various instances of the six types of consciousness that arise within that aggregate. Alternatively we can say that the arising of consciousness as a result of willful actions refers to the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">overall ability</span> to be aware that starts at birth and the arising of consciousness as a result of sense impressions to <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">specific contents</span> of awareness.

<p>In the standard sequence, sense impressions are followed by sensations (or ‘feelings’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vedanā</span>), not by consciousness. But sensations and consciousness are intrinsically connected, so when certain sensations arise, certain states of consciousness arise alongside. It is impossible to experience a sensation without being conscious of it, or to be conscious without experiencing (or sensing) anything. The terms describe different <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">aspects</span> of awareness; they are not distinct entities. Venerable Sāriputta explains:</p>

<p>As shown next, some passages also connect sense impressions directly to the arising of consciousness, not just to the arising of sensations. Such passages invariably speak of the arising of the six distinct types of consciousness, though, not of the aggregate of consciousness in general.</p>

<p>The previous chapter showed that consciousness can’t exist in isolation. It always exists alongside other parts of the being which the Buddha called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. The dependency of consciousness on sense impressions teaches a similar principle, but it has a different focus. While the dependency of consciousness on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> primarily teaches us there is no realm where consciousness can be reborn on its own, the dependency on sense impressions teaches us that even in this life instances of consciousness always depend on other things.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The word I translate as ‘sense impression’ is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">phassa</span>. It is usually translated as ‘contact’, but more literally means ‘touch’. Just like the body touches external objects, in Pāli the nose “touches” smells, the tongue “touches” flavors, and so on. When there is such “touching”, a specific type of consciousness can arise:</p>

<p>A [instance of] sight-consciousness arises dependent on the sense of sight and sights. The union of the three is a sense impression. A hearing-consciousness arises dependent on the sense of hearing and sounds. … A smell-consciousness arises dependent on the sense of smell and smells. … A taste-consciousness arises dependent on the sense of taste and flavors. … A touch-consciousness arises dependent on the sense of touch and tangibles. … A mind-consciousness arises dependent on the mind and mental phenomena.

<p>Here consciousness is said to depend on two conditions: a sense faculty and an object. In the following discourse Sāriputta adds a third: engagement, which means attention. But the word for ‘engagement’ is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samannāhāra</span>, which literally means ‘bringing together’, so it might also be a synonym for sense impression (or ‘contact’), in which case this passage doesn’t really add a third condition.<a href="#fn411" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref411" role="doc-noteref"><sup>411</sup></a></p>

Likewise, a consciousness is named after whatever its arising depends on. When a consciousness arises dependent on the sense of sight and sights, it is named sight-consciousness; when on the sense of hearing and sounds, hearing-consciousness; when on the sense of smell and smells, smell-consciousness; when on the sense of taste and flavors, taste-consciousness; when on the sense of touch and tangibles, touch-consciousness; and when on the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousness.<a href="#fn413" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref413" role="doc-noteref"><sup>413</sup></a></p>

<p>In all these discussions on sense impression there is no mention of willful actions or karma or even ignorance. So once more, to be absolutely clear: this origination of consciousness as a result of sense impressions is not the same as its origination depending on willful action. These are two different teachings which explain fundamentally different principles.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Understanding-sense-impressions-through-meditation'>Understanding sense impressions through meditation</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The teachings on sense impressions are not just abstract theories. The workings of consciousness can be seen through direct experience. To be able to do so, consciousness first has to be simplified. Just like you can’t understand a conversation when six people are talking to you at the same time, when all six senses are happening at once, it is difficult if not impossible to see how the process of consciousness functions.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This is where meditation comes in. In deep meditation the five senses are completely left behind, leaving only mind-consciousness. After such an experience of jhāna you should ask yourself whether this refined consciousness depends on an object too, just like consciousness which was based on five senses. If the object of awareness would disappear, would this mental consciousness disappear too? If you are perceptive enough, you will have to conclude that it does. Since the object of awareness in such a state is very subtle, it can be hard to come to this conclusion, which explains why some people who have these experiences take them to be some form of unity, an ultimate essence or a self.<a href="#fn420" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref420" role="doc-noteref"><sup>420</sup></a> But the Buddha said: “Any sensation coming from sense impression of the mind […] is subject to disintegration.”<a href="#fn421" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref421" role="doc-noteref"><sup>421</sup></a> The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sappurisa Sutta</span> also says that a worthy person reflects: “The Buddha has said to not identify with the attainment of the first jhāna. For whatever you imagine it is, it is different from that.”<a href="#fn422" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref422" role="doc-noteref"><sup>422</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>A further way to understand the nature of consciousness is by seeing instances of consciousness arising and ceasing more directly. Rather than reflecting back on a previous experience of meditation, the arising and ceasing of sense impressions can be perceived in real time. It is like playing a movie at slow speed and seeing it to be a collection of still images which created an illusion of continuity. You will then also realize that the six types of consciousness are indeed separate things, not joined together by anything other than the deluded mind.<a href="#fn423" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref423" role="doc-noteref"><sup>423</sup></a> I am not sure to what extent this type of experience can be actively pursued, however, or whether it just happens when the mind is ready. Either way, it will also depend on having a calm and sharp mind which has abandoned the hindrances, so my pragmatic advice in this regard would still be to develop deep states of meditation. In my view, all real understanding of consciousness will be based on these experiences, not only of its momentary arising but also of its continuation between lives.</p>

<p>The cessation sequence of Dependent Arising starts with abandoning ignorance, but as mentioned a number of times before, not all factors cease the same moment ignorance is abandoned.

In his translations of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span>, Bhikkhu Bodhi therefore translates <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bahiddhā sabbanimittā</span> simply as ‘all external objects’, akin to how I translate <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bahiddhā nāmarūpa</span> (‘external things with their names and forms’).<a href="#fn429" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref429" role="doc-noteref"><sup>429</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on the Foolish and Wise</span> uses the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in a way that is unique, namely as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bahiddhā nāmarūpa</span>, which literally means ‘<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">external</span> name and form’. The commentary interprets this to be the minds and bodies of other beings, but that is too simplistic. The term here refers to all things outside of, or external to, the being. In ancient India objects were considered to have intrinsic names and forms, just like beings. As Schmithausen noted: “Historically, the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is not limited to living beings. It can, for example in Vedic usage, refer to all sorts of individualized things.”<a href="#fn430" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref430" role="doc-noteref"><sup>430</sup></a> In this context the form is the appearance of an object in the world, the name is what the object is called. Both these aspects were considered at least by some to be essential parts of the object themselves, just like the personal name was believed to be a part of the being. “The name of the ghee […] was considered to be identical with the ghee itself”, Gonda gives as an example.<a href="#fn431" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref431" role="doc-noteref"><sup>431</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This use of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is very uncommon in the early Buddhist texts, where the term usually refers to individual beings, not objects. Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi describes <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bahiddhā nāmarūpa</span> as “a rare example of the term <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">nāmarūpa</span> being employed to represent the entire field of experience available to consciousness […] While the sense bases [i.e. the senses and their objects] are usually shown to be the condition for contact and are also called a dyad [or ‘pair’], it seems that here the text intends the term dyad to denote one’s own conscious body and ‘external name-and-form’.”<a href="#fn432" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref432" role="doc-noteref"><sup>432</sup></a> Put differently, that this is not the ordinary use of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is indicated by sense impression (or ‘contact’) arising from the conscious body and this external <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> instead of the usual six senses and their objects. This is not how the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is normally used. Hamilton stated: “In principle <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> might apply to that which is external to the human being [as in <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bahiddhā</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>]. But when it is found in the context of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> [Dependent Arising] formula it applies to the human being […] In its most common context, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> formula, it refers to name and form of the individual human being; in other contexts [the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on the Foolish and Wise</span>] it refers to the name and form of any objects.”<a href="#fn433" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref433" role="doc-noteref"><sup>433</sup></a> In other words, this discourse does not describe the ordinary <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> of Dependent Arising.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bahiddhā nāmarūpa</span> of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on the Foolish and Wise</span> are specified to be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">external</span>. This opposes them to the usual <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in Dependent Arising, which, being part of the individual, we could call internal. The Buddha was interested in the origination and cessation of suffering, which exists inside the person, not in that of external objects. As noted by Falk: “The comparatively much lesser frequency of [<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>’s] occurrence in the latter sense [of objects] is merely proportional to the uneven distribution of interest between the two unit-aspects of concrete existence: the individual and the extra-individual.”<a href="#fn434" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref434" role="doc-noteref"><sup>434</sup></a> Of note is also that the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on the Foolish and Wise</span> says the body (with its consciousness) has originated from ignorance, but the external <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> has not. This makes sense, since external objects are not created by ignorance. In contrast, the standard <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in Dependent Arising does have its roots in ignorance.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>However, some interpreters understand <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in the standard twelvefold sequence to also refer to external objects, not to the sentient being.<a href="#fn435" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref435" role="doc-noteref"><sup>435</sup></a> Others take <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> to be certain dualistic cognitions which are abandoned by enlightened beings.<a href="#fn436" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref436" role="doc-noteref"><sup>436</sup></a> The latter interpretation clashes with the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on the Foolish and Wise</span>, which says the wise still experience <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, be it of the external type. On top of that, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> ceases at the passing away of an enlightened being, not at the moment of enlightenment, and the same goes for feelings and perceptions, which are part of the definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span>.<a href="#fn437" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref437" role="doc-noteref"><sup>437</sup></a> Such interpretations also have some other problems, among which:</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Buddha’s definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> in the standard context of Dependent Arising includes things which are parts of beings and not of objects, such as attention and intention. Likewise, sense impressions, although they <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">depend</span> on the objects, are themselves not parts of objects either. The same applies to sensations and perceptions. As discussed earlier in this chapter, when sense impressions occur, sensations arise together with consciousness, both depending on the object. Sensations themselves are never treated as the object of consciousness. So this definition of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> does not apply to external <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Nāmarūpa</span> in the standard sequence is the condition for the six senses, which are defined as the faculties of the eye, ear, etc.; <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">not</span> as the objects of sights, smells, etc. Since these senses are internal and not external, so is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> which is their precursor. In simpler terms, external objects or cognitive processes don’t develop into the six senses.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The external objects or cognitions also do not depend on willful actions or karma, especially not physical and verbal ones.<a href="#fn438" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref438" role="doc-noteref"><sup>438</sup></a></p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It is said about the dependency between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> and consciousness that “it is to this extent that beings can get born, age, die, pass on, and get reborn”.<a href="#fn439" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref439" role="doc-noteref"><sup>439</sup></a> External objects and cognitive processes don’t age or die.</p>

<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The objects and cognitions are not conceived in the womb and are not reborn (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhinibbati</span>), both of which <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is said to do.<a href="#fn440" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref440" role="doc-noteref"><sup>440</sup></a></p>

<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As discussed in the previous chapter, the dependency between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> and consciousness goes both ways.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>On the last point Schmithausen wrote:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>[The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on the Foolish and Wise</span>], however, cannot be used to justify the view that in the twelve-membered formula name-and-form also means the sense <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">objects</span>. For in the twelve-membered chain ‘name-and-form’ is explicitly stated to be conditioned by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vijñāna</span>, and this is appropriate for the living sentient body, which becomes as such only through <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vijñāna</span> [continuing from the past life], but it would be remarkable for the objects. Indeed, in [this discourse] there is no mention that ‘external name-and-form’, i.e. the objects, are conditioned by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vijñāna</span>. They are referred to simply as the second condition for sense impressions [the first being the (conscious) body]; the text says nothing about their origin. […] Interdependency exists […] only between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> on the one hand—insofar as this is not so much an act of consciousness but rather the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">faculty</span> of consciousness and feeling [i.e. not moments of consciousness but the general existence of consciousness as a whole]—and on the other hand ‘name-and-form’ in the sense of this living body which contains the capacity of consciousness and feeling […]. However, an <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">inter</span>dependence between consciousness (or the sense faculties) and the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">objects</span>, is, as far as I can see, not spoken of or even hinted at anywhere.<a href="#fn442" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref442" role="doc-noteref"><sup>442</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As a matter of fact, in <a href="#bqseg101"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§101</span></a> Sāriputta states there can be external forms without an arising of consciousness: “If the internal sense of sight is intact, an external sight [or ‘form’] comes within its scope, but there is no corresponding engagement there, then the corresponding section of consciousness does not arise.” This statement allows there to be external forms without sight-consciousness, meaning the object does not depend on consciousness. The external forms here seem to be such things as the water in the ocean or a fire in a village mentioned earlier,<a href="#fn443" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref443" role="doc-noteref"><sup>443</sup></a> the “form” of which can be seen with the eye. Such things intuitively exist also when we aren’t conscious of them, even if our perceptions may not perfectly reflect what actually exists in the external world. So, the suttas are concerned with the dependency of consciousness on the objects, but not with the dependency of the objects on consciousness, otherwise Sāriputta would not have phrased things the way he did, in a teaching specifically about the relationship between consciousness and its objects. To be clear, I point this out not to make a metaphysical claim about the existence of material things external to the perceiver, nor do I suggest Sāriputta intended to do so. Such ontological speculation is not a concern of early Buddhist thought.<a href="#fn444" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref444" role="doc-noteref"><sup>444</sup></a> I point this out just to emphasize that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in the standard teachings of Dependent Arising does not refer to the objects of consciousness, since <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> is specifically said to depend on consciousness, yet the objects aren’t. Yes, in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on the Foolish and Wise</span> the term refers to the external things—therefore it is specifically called <span data-custom-style="Strong">external</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>—but in the list of twelve factors it refers to the being, to the “internal” <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reader may wonder why <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in the standard teachings is not specifically called internal, but, as discussed in <a href="#chapter3"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">Chapter 3</span></a>, this is analogous to the six senses (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saḷāyatana</span>) not being called internal. In context of Dependent Arising the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">salāyatana</span> are defined as the six sense faculties of sight, hearing, and so forth (literally the eye, ear, and so on). These are elsewhere specifically called internal, but it was considered unnecessary for this to be stated in the standard sequence, likely for sake of brevity. So too, it is assumed that the audience understands that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in Dependent Arising refers to the “internal” being, not to the external objects.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Sense-impressions-depending-on-internal-nāmarūpa'>Sense impressions depending on internal nāmarūpa</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Continuing our discussion on sense impressions, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> contains a passage which multiple intelligent scholars consider to be very cryptic or even close to nonsensical. It describes a dependency of sense impressions (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">phassa</span>) on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, which is different from its usual dependency on the six senses. Olalde says the passage is extremely unclear, and Vetter says he can make little sense of it without reading it in light of the Chinese parallels.<a href="#fn445" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref445" role="doc-noteref"><sup>445</sup></a> Venerable Bodhi is more reserved but wrote, quite out of character with the rest of his work, that “interpretation [of this passage] cannot be settled by scholarship alone but also requires reflection and intuition”, and also calls some of the terms it contains “peculiar”.<a href="#fn446" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref446" role="doc-noteref"><sup>446</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The passage uniquely splits sense impressions up into two parts: ‘impinging impression’ and ‘designating impression’. As far as the early Pāli texts go, both terms are only found in this sutta and never explained anywhere else, but it is generally understood that the former refers to the sense impressions of the five senses and the latter to the mental processes of labeling and recognition, although the commentary thinks it stands for all mental sense impressions.<a href="#fn447" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref447" role="doc-noteref"><sup>447</sup></a> I’m not fully convinced of these assumptions, but will adopt them for the sake of argument.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In ‘designating impression’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">adhivacana-samphassa</span>) there is likely a connection with the literal meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> of ‘name’. However, this does not mean that we should see the two as synonyms, that we should take <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> to be identical to this designating impression. First off, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> is a noun, not a verb. It literally means one’s proper name, not ‘nam<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">ing</span>’, which is a process.<a href="#fn448" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref448" role="doc-noteref"><sup>448</sup></a> Also, the passage in question never actually equates <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> to designating impression; it only says <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> is a necessary condition for it to occur. It does not even mention <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> itself, but refers to it in the compound <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmakāya</span>, the ‘collection of immaterial aspects’, which is another very unusual term.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Here is my translation of the passage:</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As I indicated before, it is all a bit of a riddle. But let me rephrase and explain the four points that are being made:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-list-margin">[1]</span> Suppose those things we refer to when we speak of ‘the immaterial aspects’ did not exist. (That is, there are no perceptions, sensations, attention, etc.) Then inside the body (which in that case lacks a mind) there would be no recognition of things.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This means that without mental activity you cannot recognize or label things, or as Bhikkhu Bodhi phrases it: “Designation cannot take place in a material body devoid of mentality.”<a href="#fn450" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref450" role="doc-noteref"><sup>450</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-list-margin">[2]</span> Suppose those things we refer to when we speak of ‘the bodily aspects’ did not exist. (That is, there are no organs, body parts, etc.) Then inside the mind (which in that case lacks a body) there would be no awareness of external things.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This means that without the five senses the mind can’t cognize the world. With respect to this the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahāvedalla Sutta</span> says: “The five faculties have different fields, different domains, and they do not experience each others’ fields and domain. […] The mind experiences their fields, their domains.”<a href="#fn451" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref451" role="doc-noteref"><sup>451</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-list-margin">[3]</span> Suppose those things we refer to when we speak of ‘the immaterial aspects’ and ‘the bodily aspects’ did not exist. (That is, there are no perceptions, no body parts, etc.) Then (lacking a body and mind) there would be no sense impressions at all.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-list-margin">[4]</span> Suppose that which we refer to when we speak of ‘the immaterial aspects and body’ did not exist. (That is, there is no being.) Then (since there is no existence) there would be no sense impressions at all.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>These last two statement effectively say the same thing. If there is no being, there simply are no sense impressions.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>So in this passage too I understand <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāma</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">rūpa</span> to refer to parts of the being. This understanding is shared by various scholars,<a href="#fn452" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref452" role="doc-noteref"><sup>452</sup></a> including Bhikkhu Bodhi, who wrote that “it is clear that they are intended in the narrower sense, as two sides of the sentient organism, rather than in the broader sense as including the objective sphere [i.e. external objects].”<a href="#fn453" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref453" role="doc-noteref"><sup>453</sup></a> This interpretation also fits the only other instance of the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmakāya</span> in the early Pāli corpus, which is about the passing away of an enlightened being, when body and mind disappear.<a href="#fn454" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref454" role="doc-noteref"><sup>454</sup></a> It is also supported by the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Dīrgha Āgama</span> parallel to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, which overall is very similar to the Pāli version but at this specific passage is significantly different. The following translation is by Charles Patton, who translates <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">phassa</span> (觸) as ‘contact’:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Ānanda, ‘contact exists conditioned by name and form.’ What does this mean?</p>

<p>This version is unarguably way less cryptic than the Pāli. The wording is much simpler, and it also combines statements 3 and 4—which say the same thing, anyway—into one. It is impossible to tell whether these are simplifications made by the original Chinese translator or whether this version is more authentic, although the Pāli version does sound to me rather Abhidhammic and therefore late. Either way, the parallel validates that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> was at an early age believed to refer to the individual in this context also, because it specifically speaks of the name and form of <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">beings</span> (眾).</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If we look a bit beyond this passage, there is an even clearer indication for this. Both the Chinese and Pāli discourses follow the passage directly with the development of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in the mother’s womb, where it clearly refers to the organism—for one, because it talks about the rebirth (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">abhinibbati</span>) of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>. Since there is no indication that the meaning of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> shifts between these two passages, we can conclude that in both cases it refers to the being.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>But even though <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> has the same meaning in both passages, they do not convey the same conditionality. “The two formulas have different purposes and describe different processes”, concluded also Hamilton,<a href="#fn456" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref456" role="doc-noteref"><sup>456</sup></a> with the two formulas being the extremely rare ‘sense impressions depend on the immaterial aspects and body’ and the less unique but still uncommon ‘consciousness depends on the immaterial aspects and body’. As described earlier, sense impressions happen moment by moment, while the dependency of consciousness on the immaterial aspects and body focuses on the rebirth and overall existence of the aspect of existence of consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As also mentioned a few times before, some authors think <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> in the standard sequence refers not to the being but to certain cognitive processes. Most passages commonly brought up in support of such views are not directly connected to Dependent Arising, however, and can also be interpreted differently.<a href="#fn457" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref457" role="doc-noteref"><sup>457</sup></a> Authors favoring this view also tend to emphasize the previous passage on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> and <span data-custom-style="Strong">sense impressions</span>, using it to interpret the dependency between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> and <span data-custom-style="Strong">consciousness</span>. They sideline the one passage that actually describes the dependency between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span> and consciousness, the one mentioning the mother’s womb. This is problematic, for the passage on sense impressions is not only very cryptic and unique in many ways, it does not even describe the dependency between consciousness and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>.<a href="#fn458" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref458" role="doc-noteref"><sup>458</sup></a></p>

<p>With all this in mind I consider it best to give this dependency at best a secondary place in our interpretation of the Dhamma.

<p>At the start of this book I described the all-encompassing scope of the aspect of existence of consciousness, which encapsulates all types of consciousness.

The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on the Foolish and Wise</span> (<a href="#bqseg108"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§108</span></a>) accordingly said that for both the unenlightened and the enlightened alike “there are <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">just</span> the six senses”. In the same vein, the six senses and their objects are said to be all (or ‘everything’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">sabba</span>):</p>

<p>Unless we assume the existence of a seventh set of sense faculty and object, a seventh type of dual consciousness, this statement must simply mean that there is nothing to be experienced outside of the six senses.

<p>Another exchange between Koṭṭhita and Sāriputta also says that after the six senses cease, it is incorrect to assume something else still exists:</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Koṭṭhika then asks why Sāriputta replied the way he did. Sāriputta explains that each statement elaborates (or ‘proliferates’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">papañceti</span>) beyond the proper scope of elaboration, which is the six senses. That is because all four statements assume <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">something</span> beyond the six senses. Even saying that after the six senses cease, something else <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">no longer</span> exists, assumes something else existed beforehand. This would for example be the view of the annihilationists, as the commentary indeed notes, who think that a self ceases alongside the six senses. This is a wrong view, which is why Sāriputta replies, ‘don’t say so’. Since the six senses are all there is to the individual, it is also incorrect to assume that after the death of an enlightened being something else still exists for them.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The right view which avoids all these misconceptions comes from the realization that there is nothing beyond the six senses, so that when the six senses cease permanently, there will be no experience left. This can be realized by going through a temporary cessation of all six types of consciousness by letting go of all awareness for a moment. When consciousness arises again afterwards, the mind can conclude that there is no possibility for any type of self or for any consciousness outside of the six senses.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To clarify that the permanent cessation of the six senses happens at the death of an enlightened being and not at enlightenment, in one discourse the Buddha specifically says he still has each of the six senses.<a href="#fn470" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref470" role="doc-noteref"><sup>470</sup></a> Elsewhere he refers to their cessation using the future tense:</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg114" class="anchor"></span>Trained [i.e. enlightened] mendicants understand the six faculties: the faculty of sight, the faculty of hearing, the faculty of smell, the faculty of taste, the faculty of touch, and the mental faculty.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To end this part with a little polemic, the fact that the six senses—as well as many other factors of Dependent Arising—only cease at death, presents a problem for interpretations that remove literal rebirth from Dependent Arising. By having the whole sequence cease in a moment or so, these interpretations effectively say enlightened beings, who have no more ignorance, also have no more six senses, no more consciousness, no more sensations, and so forth. They no longer get old or die either… Not only does this make no logical sense, it also goes against the many discourses which indicate enlightened beings still experience these things.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Some such interpretations do allow for rebirth on a larger timescale, being sort of a compromise,<a href="#fn472" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref472" role="doc-noteref"><sup>472</sup></a> but that way of reasoning seems logically flawed. If we hold that the six senses or old age and death, say, cease at the moment of enlightenment, then we can’t also hold they cease <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">again</span> at the end of life. Things either cease, or they do not. We can’t have it both ways.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>At times the Paṭiccasamuppāda Vibhaṅga of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span> has been referenced to support such dual interpretations. This text indeed seems to describe the twelvefold sequence in two ways: once as the process of rebirth, once as the process of the arising of momentary “dhammas”. However, it also makes a strict distinction between the two, calling the former “the sutta analysis” and the latter “the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span> analysis”. It understands the suttas to teach rebirth; the momentary process is specific to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span>. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span> analysis also doesn’t discuss the same twelve factors. It generally omits the five physical senses, for instance, referring only to the mind. In all, it teaches a distinctly different doctrine. Also, even though the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Abhidhamma</span> gets called upon for support, usually its own momentary interpretation is ignored thereafter, being replaced by the interpretations of the respective authors, which tend to be distinctly different. The only common theme is that both don’t include literal rebirth.</p>

<p>This third and final part discusses the cessation of consciousness, which is the eventual outcome of abandoning ignorance and craving.

<p>Before turning to the simile of the light beam itself, the current chapter discusses the cessation sequence of Dependent Arising, which says that if there are no willful actions at death, there can be no rebirth of consciousness. The canon describes this idea in various ways, not always using the term ‘willful actions’ but also alternatives like ‘intentions’, ‘inclinations’, ‘tendencies’, ‘attraction’, and ‘taking up’—all active forces in the mind that, just like craving, can propel the stream of consciousness into a next life.</p>

If there is an inclination, there is departing and arriving. If there is departing and arriving, there is passing on and being reborn.

<p>The three discourses on intention are part of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Many of the phrases of the origination sequence of this discourse function in parallel. As shown in the discussion of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span>, the planting and sprouting of consciousness metaphorically describes its passing on and being reborn. The term ‘inclination’ I understand here to be an inclination to a certain rebirth, being effectively synonymous to ‘what you have a tendency towards’. So despite the order of the factors, the planting of the seed of consciousness does not happen <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">before</span> one has this inclination; it occurs in tandem with it. If you have an inclination to be reborn in a certain state, you in a sense plant your consciousness there, and then that is where your next life will occur. But if you don’t have such tendencies and inclinations, there is nothing to drive consciousness on after death. You won’t “replant” your consciousness, and there will not be a next life.</p>

If there is no departing and arriving, there is no passing on and being reborn. If there is no passing on and being reborn, [after death] you will not be here, not in the beyond, nor in between the two.

As Venerable Bodhi notes to the above passage: “Though the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Theravāda Abhidhamma</span> and the commentaries argue against the existence of an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">antarabhava</span> [in-between state], a number of canonical texts seem to support this notion.”<a href="#fn480" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref480" role="doc-noteref"><sup>480</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In-between state or not, the consequence of “if you don’t need things, you won’t move” is the end of rebirth, when “there is no passing on and being reborn”.

<p>Notice especially the close connection between willful actions and taking up. These factors can be regarded as the forces in the mind that create rebirth based on ignorance and craving. Put briefly, you’ll crave whatever you are ignorant about, whatever part of the aspects of existence you haven’t fully understood to be impermanent, suffering, and without a self. Craving that, your will is directed towards it, and you will take it up again at death.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The table also indicates that the factors of consciousness and existence cease in parallel. With this knowledge, let’s recall the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span>, which says: “If you have abandoned desire […] there will be no support for the planting of consciousness […]. Not planted, consciousness will not sprout.” We can now also rephrase this as: “If you have abandoned craving, there will be no taking up of a next existence. Not continuing to exist, there will be no future birth.” What I’m saying (in a convoluted way, but I’ll be more direct in the next chapter) is that not planting the seed of consciousness implies the end of rebirth and existence. As Kalupahana wrote: “In the case of a person who has attained enlightenment and has therefore eliminated craving for existence, consciousness finds no support [<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span>] in a new psychophysical personality [<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>], and as a result he is not reborn.”<a href="#fn486" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref486" role="doc-noteref"><sup>486</sup></a></p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The metaphor of the seed has its limitations, as all metaphors do. What happens to an unplanted physical seed does not accurately represent what happens to consciousness. While an unplanted physical seed keeps existing, when the metaphorical seed of consciousness is not planted again after death, consciousness completely ceases. We found similar limitations in the simile of the bundles of reeds. We must keep in mind the main message of the simile of the seed. The central point is not what happens to the seed, but that when no seed is planted, there is no growth of another plant, which illustrates there being no next life after death. If, however, we wish to extend the metaphor of the seed, we can imagine that unplanted seeds that are “not broken, spoiled, or damaged by the wind or sun” eventually will break. This then represents consciousness coming to an end.<a href="#fn487" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref487" role="doc-noteref"><sup>487</sup></a></p>

<p>The first two texts both contain <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, which some translators have translated as ‘unestablished consciousness’.

<p>But we can wonder, if <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> refers to the cessation of consciousness, how does this fit the simile of the light beam? To start answering that question, let’s recall the metaphor of the seed, which tells us that if the seed of consciousness is not planted in anything when there is no desire, it cannot continue to exist. The desire for existence is what keeps consciousness moving from life to life. If there is no such desire anymore, there is no more cause for the continuation of consciousness after death. The seed of consciousness then no longer gets planted in any realm, and there will be no next life. As the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">First Discourse on Intention</span> puts it:</p>

<p>This is a very neat summary of the fundamental principles of the cessation sequence of Dependent Arising. It is all about ending existence through stopping the mental forces that generate rebirth.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The simile of the light beam describes the same principles. I interpret it as follows: The wall, earth, and water stand for the three realms of existence, just like the board, wall, and canvas in the simile of the painting. Helmut Hecker thought the same: “The triad of wall, earth, and water could here refer to the ‘three worlds’. […] The wall is the coarsest footing (sense world); the natural earth […] is comparable to the [form] world; and the finer substance of the water would be comparable to the formless world.”<a href="#fn495" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref495" role="doc-noteref"><sup>495</sup></a> If the light beam were to hit any of the three surfaces, the surface is lit up. This stands for consciousness taking rebirth in the respective realm. But if the beam does not hit anything, if it does not “plant down” anywhere, nothing lights up. This stands for consciousness not going to any of the three realms after death.<a href="#fn496" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref496" role="doc-noteref"><sup>496</sup></a> Not being reborn, consciousness will cease, just like a beam of light traveling through air will eventually fade out.</p>

<p>It would be wrong to assume the Buddha intended the beam of light, and therefore consciousness, to continue forever. As Langer criticized Harvey, this is “over-interpreting the simile of the sun beam”.<a href="#fn497" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref497" role="doc-noteref"><sup>497</sup></a> Recall the limited nature of the simile of the seed.

(That they had little scientific understanding is shown by the belief, mentioned in the same discourse, that the earth floated on water.)<a href="#fn498" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref498" role="doc-noteref"><sup>498</sup></a> When imagining a beam that doesn’t hit anything, they would not have envisioned a beam of light that continues forever in the endless void of space, like we might nowadays.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Saṁyukta Āgama</span> sheds light on the matter too. While the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> in the Pāli Canon has two distinct similes to describe the origination and cessation of consciousness (respectively the painting and the light beam) the Chinese collection contains multiple parallel sutras which apply similar similes to both origination and cessation. One of these sutras illustrates the arising of consciousness with a painter who draws a picture, just as the Pāli, but the cessation of consciousness with a painter who fails to paint an image on empty space.<a href="#fn499" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref499" role="doc-noteref"><sup>499</sup></a> The idea of being unable to paint on empty space also occurs elsewhere in the Pāli Canon, with no connection to Dependent Arising or consciousness,<a href="#fn500" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref500" role="doc-noteref"><sup>500</sup></a> but it seems this idea, although left unspoken in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span>, is also implied there. This imagery clarifies the simile of the beam. Just like no figure can be painted on empty air, a beam of light cannot alight empty air. This, as the parallel sutras also state, stands for there being “no production of future existence” (當來有不生) when “consciousness no longer exists” (識不住).</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Some authors, although they may not believe in a consciousness after <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>, still suggest <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> could be some sort of unestablished consciousness of <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">living</span> enlightened beings.<a href="#fn501" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref501" role="doc-noteref"><sup>501</sup></a> But enlightened beings still have the standard aggregate of consciousness, not a special kind of consciousness. It is of course true that their minds are free from a sense of self and all defilements that spring from it, but their consciousness is still dependently originated through sense impressions and still depends on its objects. Their aggregate of consciousness also still exists in a certain realm where at their birth it was established or ‘planted’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭha</span>). As Langer explains: “The <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">viññāṇa</span> of an arahant is still <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭha</span>—that is, fixed in a form of existence such as a body—as long as his lifespan is not exhausted.”<a href="#fn502" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref502" role="doc-noteref"><sup>502</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Langer is also somewhat open to the possibility that the enlightened one’s consciousness may be unestablished in some other sense during their life, like it no longer being attached to anything. I agree with this on a pragmatic level but disagree with the semantics, because it doesn’t seem to be what the Buddha meant by <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>. As explained, the non-establishment of consciousness refers to its cessation, and this only happens when the enlightened one passes away. <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> specifically implies the cessation of existence, not an undetached state of mind, which is why the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">If There is Desire Discourse</span> follows it directly with “there is no conception of any immaterial aspects and body” and “no existence in a future life is produced”.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In her defense, Langer relies largely on the Seeds Discourse, one line of which she reads as follows: “This non-established consciousness, not growing [or ‘sprouting’], not willing, is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">liberated</span>.”<a href="#fn503" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref503" role="doc-noteref"><sup>503</sup></a> At first glance this is a natural translation, and it indeed sounds like consciousness is liberated and non-established for the living enlightened being. However, when we consider the context and Chinese parallels, this is not the preferred reading. Like Nyānaponika and other translators, I think it should be interpreted differently.<a href="#fn504" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref504" role="doc-noteref"><sup>504</sup></a> I translated it as: “Not planted, consciousness will not sprout [in a next life].

<p>If they don’t have a type of unestablished consciousness, how do enlightened beings actually experience consciousness? That is an interesting question, but it may be somewhat misguided.

But this feeling of there being something inside that is aware of it all—whether we call it ‘me’, ‘the knower’, ‘unestablished consciousness’, or whatever—is actually the deluded sense of self.

Sense impressions happen without anybody experiencing them, without any ‘I’. They happen simply because there are the six senses. As seen before, enlightened beings still have the six senses and still undergo sense impressions. Therefore, as stated at <a href="#bqseg106"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§106</span></a>, their consciousness also “sways and wavers; it is temporary, changing, and fluctuating”. Elsewhere the Buddha says that when ignorance is abandoned, the six types of sense impression and consciousness still exist; they are just looked at differently.<a href="#fn512" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref512" role="doc-noteref"><sup>512</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Certain interpretations of Dependent Arising also suggest that ignorance creates a certain duality between subject and object.

It is actually the sense of self which makes it seem like awareness and its objects have something in common, hence making it feel nondual. This delusion is more subtle than what many think the sense of self is all about: the thoughts of ‘I’ (in here) versus ‘them’ (out there), which is a certain kind of “duality” which indeed has to be abandoned, although the suttas never call this a duality or treat it as such. The duality the discourses actually describe exists on a deeper level and is not abandoned by the enlightened one. When it is understood, consciousness is perceived as it actually is: to be the result of what the Buddha called a ‘pair’ (or ‘duality’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dvaya</span>, the same word as in Advaita).<a href="#fn515" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref515" role="doc-noteref"><sup>515</sup></a> As the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Discourse on the Foolish and Wise</span> said, this pair still exists for the wise.<a href="#fn516" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref516" role="doc-noteref"><sup>516</sup></a> Consciousness isn’t nondual.

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Consciousness-as-a-magic-trick'>Consciousness as a magic trick</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Of all five aspects of existence consciousness is especially prone to illusions of sameness and self. This may explain why another simile compares it to a magic trick:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§128</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Mendicants, imagine an illusion which a magician or a magician’s apprentice displays at a crossroad. A man with good eyesight inspects it, examines it, and properly investigates it. To him it will appear void, hollow, and without an essence. For what essence can there be in an illusion? Likewise, you inspect, examine, and properly investigate whatever consciousness there may be—whether past, present, or future; here or elsewhere; internal or external; coarse or subtle; lowly or sublime. To you it will appear void, hollow, and without an essence. For what essence can there be in consciousness?<a href="#fn517" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref517" role="doc-noteref"><sup>517</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This is all the discourses say about this simile, so we must be careful when making any inferences beyond those obviously intended. It is incorrect to say consciousness creates the illusion, for instance.<a href="#fn518" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref518" role="doc-noteref"><sup>518</sup></a> Consciousness is compared to an illusion, but it is the magician who creates this illusion, not consciousness itself. And in a deeper sense it is actually the audience who upholds the illusion by not understanding the magician’s trick. So if I were to expand on the simile, I’d do so with reservation, but would suggest that the magician stands for ignorance, and that the real illusion is not consciousness itself but the unenlightened person’s delusion that there is a constant entity in it. If consciousness itself created the delusion, this would be problematic, because enlightened beings still have consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Enlightened beings have seen the empty nature of the five aspects of existence completely. They still experience them, but they no longer perceive a self in it, no longer identify with it. A well-known passage also explains this:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§129</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Any kind of form … sensation … perception … will … consciousness in terms of which you might declare there to be <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">a truth­finder</span>, truth­finders have let go of. They cut it off at its roots, made it like a palm stump, put an end to it, so that it will not rearise in the future. Truth­finders no longer identify with consciousness, being as deep, as difficult to get to the bottom of, and as hard to fathom as the ocean.<a href="#fn519" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref519" role="doc-noteref"><sup>519</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The passage is a bit cryptic. Notice first that the Buddha says truth­finders (which here stands for any enlightened beings) made the aspects of existence not rearise <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">in the future</span>. In other words, the aspects of existence including consciousness still exist, but they won’t be recreated through rebirth. Enlightened beings have put an end to them in the same sense that pressing the power button on a computer brings the operating system to an end. The screen doesn’t become blank instantly. The computer will still have to go through its shutdown sequence. This shutdown sequence is like the last life of the enlightened being.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Others might say or “declare” that there is a truly existent <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">truth­finder</span> in terms of consciousness, that there is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">a truth­finder</span> who <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">has</span>, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">is</span>, or <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">owns</span> consciousness. But to the enlightened one there is just essence-less consciousness without any owner or experiencer. They no longer identify with consciousness in any way. They no longer identify with the label ‘truth­finder’ either, which others reify to be some kind of being or self. This lack of identification is deep and hard to fathom.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The next chapter discusses this absence of a self (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anatta</span>) further. It is nearly impossible to put this principle into words without sounding alien. Even saying “<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">they</span> don’t identify” already implies too much, because there is no substantial, unchanging <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">they</span> as such. Therefore, when the Buddha says truth­finders are like an ocean, it doesn’t mean that truth­finders truly exist as an entity.<a href="#fn520" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref520" role="doc-noteref"><sup>520</sup></a> It is just a way of speaking, another metaphor. In fact, too get overly philosophical, even ‘ocean’ is just a concept that only exists in the mind, just a name for a collection of water droplets that constantly evaporate and rain down again.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>“Their” insight into the temporary and empty nature of consciousness makes “truth­finders” drop all attachment to it. The cessation of consciousness will be perceived as a higher peace, with consciousness considered to be suffering in comparison. With this insight, consciousness will not be planted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>) in a next life. Not being replanted, consciousness will cease.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In one sutta—the narrative of which I take with a big pinch of salt, but which is illustrative regardless—a monk named Godhika commits suicide but attains enlightenment at the time of his death.

I am also skeptical of highly developed beings committing suicide, but for the sake of discussion I will treat the discourse literally from hereon.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Notice that Māra says he searched for where <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">Godhika had gone</span> and the Buddha says Māra searched for where <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">consciousness was planted</span>. This confirms two things I suggested earlier: that consciousness can refer to the person more generally, and that its planting refers to going to a certain place after death.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As discussed in the previous chapter, there have been suggestions that ‘with no consciousness planted’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭha viññāṇa</span>) describes the living enlightened being. But when the Buddha says Godhika had no consciousness planted anywhere, he is not referring to Godhika’s consciousness while he was still alive. Firstly, Māra searched for Godhika’s consciousness only after he died, wondering where Godhika has gone. He wanted to know where Godhika was reborn, where his consciousness was planted (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭhita</span>). This idea is accordingly translated as “where his consciousness was reborn” (識神當生何處) in a <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Saṁyukta Āgama</span> parallel to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Vakkali Sutta</span>, a text about a monk named Vakkali with a very similar storyline.<a href="#fn523" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref523" role="doc-noteref"><sup>523</sup></a> In an <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Ekottarika</span> parallel, Māra wonders where Vakkali’s consciousness was established (識為何所在), in what realm it was reborn and where it had travelled on to (在何處生遊), whether he had become human or non-human, a god or spirit or such.<a href="#fn524" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref524" role="doc-noteref"><sup>524</sup></a> Both parallels confirm that the process that gets reborn was called ‘consciousness’<a href="#fn525" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref525" role="doc-noteref"><sup>525</sup></a> and that the planting of consciousness refers to being reborn in a certain place. In this light it makes sense for the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">not</span> planting of consciousness to mean not going to any place after death, not some sort of enlightened state of mind. Secondly, the non-planting of consciousness can’t refer to the living being because Godhika (as well as Vakkali) wasn’t yet enlightened while still alive. The discourse says before death he only attained <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">temporary</span> liberation of mind, which refers to states of meditation.<a href="#fn526" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref526" role="doc-noteref"><sup>526</sup></a> He attained enlightenment only at the point of dying, at which moment he didn’t plant his consciousness in a new state of existence.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>After they pass away, enlightened beings “have no destination”, because they “broke apart transmigration, cut off all destinations, won’t have a next life” and “will not be reborn anywhere at all”.<a href="#fn527" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref527" role="doc-noteref"><sup>527</sup></a> That is something the ordinary gods don’t understand, which is why Māra kept looking for Godhika.</p>

<p>The Buddha also said:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This doesn’t mean enlightened beings have some sort of mystical destination which is unknown to others.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The reason Māra could not find Godhika’s consciousness is that, as the Buddha states, Godhika got fully extinguished.

<p>A <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Saṁyukta Āgama</span> parallel to the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Godhika Sutta</span> verifies this understanding.

<p>Māra was not the only divine being seeking in vain for the consciousness of an enlightened being who passed away.

In this context ‘truth­finder’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tathāgata</span>)<a href="#fn531" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref531" role="doc-noteref"><sup>531</sup></a> refers to any enlightened being, not just the Buddha.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>When I state and explain this, some renunciants and brahmins slander me, baselessly, untruthfully, and falsely arguing that I am an annihilationist.

In the past and also now, what I declare is that there is only suffering and a cessation of suffering.<a href="#fn532" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref532" role="doc-noteref"><sup>532</sup></a></p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Like Māra’s search for Godhika, this passage could be symbolic. It might just say that enlightened beings surpass even the most powerful gods and are not reborn even among them. However, I will treat it literally again.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The phrase “even while alive there is no truth­finder to be found”<a href="#fn533" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref533" role="doc-noteref"><sup>533</sup></a> was translated by Venerable Bodhi as “one thus gone (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">tathāgata</span>) is untraceable here and now”, but this does not mean that there exists some real tathāgata-being who is somehow “untraceable”. Despite this potentially confusing translation, Bodhi notes the commentary understands this sentence to be about <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anatta</span>, the absence of a self.<a href="#fn534" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref534" role="doc-noteref"><sup>534</sup></a> The commentary is correct, for this is what the discourse explained at great length just before and continues with afterwards. The idea is that there is no entity called ‘a truth­finder’ in the first place. The word is nothing but a label for empty processes, a convenient way to refer to the five aspects of existence of the enlightened one. In other words, there is no essence or self to be found, nothing which truly is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">the</span> truth­finder. There is no such fundamentally existing truth­finder, not only after death, when existence has ceased, but also before, while the enlightened being (or more correctly, the enlightened set of khandhas) was still alive.<a href="#fn535" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref535" role="doc-noteref"><sup>535</sup></a> Venerable Bodhi therefore also wrote: “He [the enlightened being] does not even see a self-existent Tathāgata to die, let alone to be eternalized or annihilated after death.”<a href="#fn536" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref536" role="doc-noteref"><sup>536</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Because there is no essence in the five aspects of existence including consciousness, when consciousness is no longer supported by anything, it can completely cease at <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>. That is why the gods are unable to find any enlightened being or their consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>There are a couple of verses in the Pāli Canon in which gods also seem to be unable to find the enlightened being while alive, which seems to refer to them no longer thinking in terms of ‘I exist’.<a href="#fn537" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref537" role="doc-noteref"><sup>537</sup></a> But unlike the above passage, these texts don’t mention a search for consciousness, which I think is an important difference. In the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Simile of the Snake Discourse</span> ‘consciousness’ I suggest means that which continues from life to life. When the gods failed to find the enlightened one’s consciousness, they failed to find where they were reborn. This may not be immediately obvious, because the text does not explicitly mention that anyone has died. As a result the passage has been interpreted to describe the enlightened mind during life.<a href="#fn538" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref538" role="doc-noteref"><sup>538</sup></a> But there are multiple reasons that the passage may instead concern what happens after death. The rest of this chapter will share these reasons while also further explaining the concept of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">anatta</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Deities-looking-for-the-place-of-rebirth'>Deities looking for the place of rebirth</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="Strong">first reason</span> that the inquiry of the gods in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Simile of the Snake Discourse</span> could concern the enlightened being who passed away, is the great similarity with Māra’s inquiry in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Godhika Sutta</span>. Māra sought but could not find where Godhika’s consciousness was planted after his death; the gods sought but could not find what the consciousness of the enlightened mendicant was supported by. The words for ‘sought’ and ‘cannot find’ are the exact same in both cases, as is of course ‘consciousness’. The words ‘supported’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nissita</span>) and ‘planted’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">patiṭṭha</span>) are different but convey the same idea. There is a direct connection between them in the sentence: “All seeds and plants that develop, sprout, and mature, do so <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">supported</span> by the earth, <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">planted</span> in the earth.”<a href="#fn539" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref539" role="doc-noteref"><sup>539</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span> says that if the seed of consciousness is not fueled by desire for the aspects of existence, it can’t be planted in a next life, because “when desire is abandoned, its foundation is destroyed” (<a href="#bqseg76"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§76</span></a>). Put differently, without a foundation (i.e. support) consciousness cannot be established in any realm. When the gods failed to find what the consciousness of the enlightened mendicant was supported by, it therefore means they could not find where they were reborn. They were in the same situation as Māra failing to find where Godhika’s consciousness was planted.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The next verse conveys the same idea, using nearly identical expressions for ‘search’ and ‘will not find’:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§134</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p><span id="bqseg134" class="anchor"></span>They stopped defining themselves, didn’t fall into conceit.<br>
They cut the knots, were untroubled, without wants.<br>
In life they cut off craving for any immaterial aspects or body.<br>

in this world or the beyond, they will not find them,<br>
not in heaven nor in any abode.<a href="#fn540" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref540" role="doc-noteref"><sup>540</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This verse too concerns the situation after death.<a href="#fn541" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref541" role="doc-noteref"><sup>541</sup></a> The past tense used in the first two lines already indicates this, referring back to when the enlightened one was still alive, and the line “<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">in life</span> they cut off craving for any immaterial aspects and body” makes it unmistakable. A verse in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Suttanipāta</span> mentions the same: “In life he cut off craving for any immaterial aspects and body […] he crossed over birth and death.”<a href="#fn542" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref542" role="doc-noteref"><sup>542</sup></a> The Buddha said this after being asked by Vaṅgīsa whether his recently deceased preceptor had attained full extinguishment or not.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Both verses specifically mention craving for any immaterial aspects and body (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>), which is also illustrative. As we have seen, in Dependent Arising this factor has a strong link with rebirth, just like consciousness. If there is no desire for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nāmarūpa</span>, then there is no support for the rebirth of consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="Strong">second reason</span> the inquiry of the gods in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Simile of the Snake Discourse</span> concerns the situation after death, is that the gods are specifically looking for the enlightened one’s <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">consciousness</span>. I fail to see why they would try to do this for a living enlightened being, who is generally still conscious. The gods are instead looking for the enlightened being after death, with “what consciousness is supported by” referring to the place where they thought their consciousness could have been reborn. I suppose that ordinarily they see beings dying and getting reborn in various places, using the divine sight they, as divine beings, possess. But when an enlightened being dies, they see no one going anywhere, so then they start wondering where their consciousness has gone. In this context ‘consciousness’ means the life force or mind that travels on and continues from life to life, not just mere awareness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>If we understood the gods’ quest for the support of consciousness to occur while the enlightened one was still alive, it would mean they were attempting to read their minds in one way or other, somehow wondering how the enlightened one’s consciousness would be supported during their life. This inquiry seems not only rather strange, it also has no equivalent anywhere in the canon. The divine sight that sees beings getting reborn is mentioned frequently, on the other hand. We can also wonder, if the gods <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">were</span> doing some sort of mind reading, why would they suddenly be unable to do so for an enlightened one? In other places in the canon, various gods, Māra included, seem to have no trouble reading even the mind of the Buddha.<a href="#fn543" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref543" role="doc-noteref"><sup>543</sup></a> Finally, if they <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">did</span> try to read the enlightened being’s mind to see “what that truth­finder’s consciousness is supported by”—assuming such a question makes sense to ask of a living person—why would the answer be different from that of unenlightened beings? As we have seen, consciousness arises dependent on an object and is established in a certain realm even for the wise. So while alive, in this sense the consciousness of the enlightened one is still supported by something.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Only-suffering-ceases'>Only suffering ceases</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="Strong">third reason</span> the passage seems to concern the situation after death, is that the Buddha, after he declares the gods’ inability to find the consciousness of an enlightened being, gets accused of being an annihilationist. The annihilationists believed there is a real existent being, a self, that gets destroyed at death. The Buddha instead taught that life, including consciousness, is a process which has no self, so when consciousness ceases at the death of an enlightened one, nothing of essence is annihilated. But when he indicated this by saying that the gods can’t find the consciousness (because it doesn’t exist anymore), some in his audience misunderstood it as the annihilation of an essence and then accused the Buddha of being an annihilationist. If the passage concerned the consciousness of a living being, they would have had no reason to do so.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Buddha responds to the accusations by saying, “there is only suffering and a cessation of suffering”. This means that, while annihilationists declared there to be a real existent being or self that gets annihilated, the Buddha declared there is only suffering, no self, so that what ceases is also only suffering, not a self. The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Madhyama Āgama</span> clarifies this idea further:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§135</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>There is no self; there is nothing that belongs to a self; [all this] is empty of a self and empty of anything that belongs to a self. When phenomena arise, they arise; when phenomena cease, they cease. All this is [just] a combination of causes and conditions, giving rise to suffering. If the causes and conditions were not present, then all suffering would cease.<a href="#fn544" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref544" role="doc-noteref"><sup>544</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Venerable Vajirā likewise said:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§136</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>Just as there is the word ‘chariot’<br>
for an assembly of parts,<br>
so there is just the convention ‘a being’<br>
when there are the aspects of existence.</p>

<p>It is only suffering that comes to be,<br>
only suffering that exists and vanishes.<br>
Nothing but suffering comes to be;<br>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In other words, life is just a collection of the aspects of existence (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">khandhas</span>). There is no real <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">being</span> inside these aspects of existence, like there is no real <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">truth­finder</span> either. Both ‘being’ and ‘truth­finder’ are just conventional labels that people use; they don’t exist in any fundamental sense, just like a chariot is just a name for a collection of parts. Therefore, when suffering ceases, it is just suffering that ceases, not a self.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The same point is made more systematically in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Yamaka Sutta</span>, where Venerable Yamaka initially holds an annihilationist view:</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To summarize, when an enlightened “being” passes away, in reality it is only the cessation of the five aspects of existence. No real <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">being</span> or <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">truth­finder</span> or <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">mendicant</span> is ever destroyed, because those things didn’t exist as true entities in the first place. There were only the temporary aspects of existence, only suffering. And because these were ephemeral and without substance from the start, their ending is not rightly called annihilation, but called cessation instead.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Yamaka Sutta</span> also brings us to the <span data-custom-style="Strong">fourth reason</span> the gods’ search for consciousness happened after death. The phrase “since you can’t find a truth­finder to actually or really exist even while alive”, which Sāriputta spoke here, is almost identical to “even while alive there is no truth­finder to be found”, which the Buddha spoke in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Simile of the Snake Discourse</span> when he explained why the gods can’t find the truth­finder. We can compare this to <a href="#bqseg90"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§90</span></a>, which uses a similar phrasing: “A self or anything belonging to a self are not found to actually or really exist.” The point is, again, that even in their lifetime ‘truth­finder’ was only a label for the self-less aspects of existence.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The words I translated as ‘even while alive’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">diṭṭheva dhamme</span>) are continually contrasted to a situation after death.<a href="#fn547" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref547" role="doc-noteref"><sup>547</sup></a> Their inclusion in the statement of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Simile of the Snake Discourse</span> indicates a contrast between life and death is also intended there.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The full phrase spoken by Venerable Sāriputta also occurs in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Anurādha Sutta</span>, where Venerable Anurādha holds an unspecified view of an existent truth­finder after death:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§138</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“But, Anurādha, since you can’t find <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">a truth­finder</span> to actually or really exist even while alive, was it right for you to say: ‘When the Truth­finder describes a truth­finder—the best and highest of persons, who attained the highest—he declares them to be outside of the four cases: after death a truth­finder still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists’?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The fundamental idea is again the same: all four cases, plus Anurādha’s fifth, are false because they all rely on the premise that there is or was an entity called <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">a truth­finder</span>, i.e., a self.<a href="#fn549" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref549" role="doc-noteref"><sup>549</sup></a> Views that presume the truth­finder to be a real thing are also called imagination (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">maññita</span>) of something that doesn’t really exist and elaboration (or ‘proliferation’, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">papañca</span>) beyond what actually exists.<a href="#fn550" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref550" role="doc-noteref"><sup>550</sup></a></p>

<p>When Anāthapiṇḍika said his pains were not subsiding, he effectively told Sāriputta he was dying. As a response Sāriputta gave a teaching specifically for the dying man, starting with: “<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">In that case</span> [since you’re going to die soon], train yourself like this.” The discourse indeed says Anāthapiṇḍika passed away soon after.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Sāriputta’s instructions are in the future tense, which is also telling, because it is a very unusual way of teaching in Pāli. Sāriputta is specifically telling Anāthapiṇḍika what attitude to have at a later point in time, the time surrounding his death. At that point Anāthapiṇḍika should not have his consciousness supported by anything, including not by this world or another world, so that, as Sāriputta said elsewhere, “the stream of consciousness […] does not get planted back in this world and does not get planted in another world”.<a href="#fn552" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref552" role="doc-noteref"><sup>552</sup></a> Sāriputta’s instruction to not support consciousness with the aspects of existence is what the Buddha taught in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span>: “If you have abandoned desire for form, sensation, perception, and will, there will be no support for the planting of consciousness, because when desire is abandoned, its foundation is destroyed.” I discussed extensively why this refers to rebirth, and this is what the advice to Anāthapiṇḍika is about as well.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The point being, the word for ‘supported’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nissita</span>) Sāriputta used in his instructions to Anāthapiṇḍika is the exact same the Buddha used in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Simile of the Snake Discourse</span> when he mentioned gods looking for what the consciousness of a truth­finder was <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">supported</span> by. So this is another indication the gods were searching for the enlightened being after they passed away.</p>

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To close this chapter, below is one more statement on not supporting consciousness:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§140</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>[…] they attain equanimity. If they don’t enjoy, welcome, or keep holding on to that equanimity, it is no longer a support or fuel for consciousness. A mendicant without fuel/taking up, gets fully extinguished.<a href="#fn553" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref553" role="doc-noteref"><sup>553</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This statement first mentions the enlightened being, who no longer holds on to things, but it has implications that go beyond enlightenment. It stems from the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Way to the Undisturbable Discourse</span>, which in an earlier passage (<a href="#bqseg56"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§56</span></a>) said consciousness will travel on after death if it still has an attachment to the equanimity of the undisturbable states of meditation. The above statement closely follows that passage. It tells us that consciousness which is no longer supported by such equanimity, will no longer travel on after death.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>When consciousness doesn’t travel on after death, the result is full extinguishment (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>), about which the Buddha also said: “Leaving no remnant, after this life, is where existence (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhava</span>) completely ceases.”<a href="#fn554" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref554" role="doc-noteref"><sup>554</sup></a> At that point consciousness will completely cease as well. The connection <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">no craving › no fuel/taking up › no existence</span> of the default cessation sequence is the same as the implied <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">no enjoyment › no fuel/taking up › no consciousness</span> in the above passage.</p>

<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-The-“state”-of-non-consciousness'>The “state” of non-consciousness</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In his instructions to Anāthapiṇḍika, Sāriputta gave a long list of potential supports for consciousness, but he did not include the cessation of perception and feeling (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saññāvedayitanirodha</span>), which I prefer to call ‘the cessation of awareness and what is experienced’. <a href="#fn555" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref555" role="doc-noteref"><sup>555</sup></a>This omission is purposeful, because consciousness is inseparable from perceptions and sensations, as mentioned at <a href="#bqseg99"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§99</span></a>. When their cessation is reached, consciousness therefore stops as well. That is why this state can’t function as a support for consciousness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The cessation of awareness and what is experienced is only temporary. Consciousness does not cease forever upon its attainment and can come back again. It only ceases forever when an enlightened being dies. Then “only bodily remains will be left” and there is “no more consciousness at all”:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§141</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Imagine a man would take a pot out of a potter’s kiln and place it on the smooth ground. Its heat would dissipate right then, and mere potsherds would be left over. Likewise, [as an enlightened being] you understand that when your body falls apart, after death, when life comes to an end, all that is experienced, not being enjoyed, will cool off right then, and only bodily remains will be left.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>These statements clarify that no type of consciousness remains after an enlightened being passes away. Note also the final phrase, “<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">just that</span> is the end of suffering”, which we already encountered in <a href="#bqseg116"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§116</span></a>. If the meaning of this phrase is not already clear, I will explain it in a moment. It is also used in an inspired utterance in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Udāna</span> to describe the “state” of permanent non-consciousness that results after the enlightened being passes away:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§142</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg142" class="anchor"></span>The Buddha was once staying in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park at Savatthi. He was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the mendicants with a talk on extinguishment (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbāna</span>). The mendicants were paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. At that time, realizing this, the Buddha spoke this inspired utterance:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Mendicants, there is a state where there is no earth, no water, no fire, no air; no state of unbounded space, no state of unbounded consciousness, no state of nothingness, no state of neither awareness nor nonawareness; no this world, no other world, no sun, no moon. There, I tell you, there is no arriving, no departing, no abiding, no passing on, and no rebirth. It is with nothing planted, not moving on, without foundation. Just that is the end of suffering.”<a href="#fn557" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref557" role="doc-noteref"><sup>557</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The “state” of the inspired utterance in contemporary Buddhism is called ‘parinibbāna’, meaning ‘full extinguishment’. I will use this term as well, although the suttas do not use <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span> exclusively in this sense. Sometimes the term refers to enlightenment, which is the full extinguishment of craving. Likewise, the term <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbāna</span> (without <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">pari</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">-</span>) is also used for the passing away of an enlightened being.<a href="#fn558" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref558" role="doc-noteref"><sup>558</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The word for ‘state’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span>) is also translated as ‘realm’, ‘dimension’, ‘base’, ‘field’, and ‘sphere’, among many other alternatives. As this variety indicates, the word has a broad and vague meaning. Despite this, some interpreters think it tells us something important about the nature of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>, namely that it indicates it to be a type of transcendent existence or consciousness. In what I consider to be a rare misjudgment, Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi reifies <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span> in such a way: “Suttas speak of [pari]nibbāna as […] a base [<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span>] where none of the conditioned phenomena of the world are to be found. Such descriptions, while cryptic and still expressed by way of negations, point to nibbāna as a transcendent, ever-existent state”, by which he means that it is “not the mere […] cessation of existence” but a state where some transcendental experience remains.<a href="#fn559" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref559" role="doc-noteref"><sup>559</sup></a> Others have used the same reasoning to support ideas of a permanent unestablished consciousness.<a href="#fn560" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref560" role="doc-noteref"><sup>560</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>As Venerable Bodhi himself admits, when describing this ‘state’ or ‘base’, the Buddha just gives a long list of negations. This tells us nothing about what this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> is; it only tells us what it is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">not</span>. Any transcendentalist interpretation of this passage therefore relies on the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> alone. Before coming to any weighty conclusions, we should therefore determine whether <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> necessarily refers to a state of existence. We find that it does not.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sīgālovāda Sutta</span> mentions, in the translations of both Walshe and Sujato, susceptibility (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span>) to illness when drinking alcohol.<a href="#fn561" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref561" role="doc-noteref"><sup>561</sup></a> In this case <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> means something like ‘option’ or ‘case’, or ‘occasion’ or ‘opportunity’, as dictionaries suggest.<a href="#fn562" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref562" role="doc-noteref"><sup>562</sup></a> It is somewhat similar to how in English something can be within the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">realm</span> of possibility. The word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> has a similar meaning in other places, as in “opportunities (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatanas</span>) for liberation”.<a href="#fn563" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref563" role="doc-noteref"><sup>563</sup></a> Quite tellingly, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Pañcattaya Sutta</span> calls the theory of annihilationism (among other wrong views) an <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span>.<a href="#fn564" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref564" role="doc-noteref"><sup>564</sup></a> So <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> by itself has no definite existential meaning—annihilation can in fact be regarded as the very antithesis of that. Since the inspired utterance further only contains negations, it therefore is ill-advised to base one’s interpretation of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span> on this term.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I translated <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> as ‘state’ in the inspired utterance primarily to keep consistency with the formless attainments, also called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatanas</span>, which I prefer to call ‘states’ rather than ‘bases’ or alike. But with this translation I do not mean an existent reality. I use ‘state’ in the same sense as ‘the unconscious state’ or ‘the off state’. However, instead of a certain state, the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> in this case more likely conveys that the cessation of suffering is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">possible</span>, similar to its meaning in the examples just given. It is not meant to reify <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>This is confirmed by another discourse which uses <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> with reference to the end of suffering. The Buddha says: “You should understand<a href="#fn565" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref565" role="doc-noteref"><sup>565</sup></a> the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> when the sense of sight and perception of sights cease, the sense of hearing and perceptions of sounds cease, the sense of smell and perceptions of smells cease, the sense of taste and perceptions of flavors cease, the sense of touch and perceptions of tangibles cease, and the mind and perceptions of mental phenomena cease.”<a href="#fn566" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref566" role="doc-noteref"><sup>566</sup></a> When Ānanda is subsequently asked what the Buddha was referring to with this “<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span>”, he replies that he was referring just to the cessation of the six senses. It is quite a funny encounter. Although the other mendicants ask Ānanda for further details, his explanation is even shorter than the Buddha’s original statement. Ānanda is basically saying: “There is nothing I can add. It refers just to the cessation of the six senses!” He does not mention the existence of anything, let alone a transcendent, ever-existent state, even though this would have been a perfect occasion to do so. When the Buddha later affirms Ānanda’s explanation, he does not do so either. This refusal to assert that anything exists after <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>, aligns with the observations of Chapter 9, that the six senses encompass all that can be experienced.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In sum, the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> in this context refers to the possibility of cessation, not to a certain realm or place. In that light, if we adopt ‘case’ for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span>, the translation becomes: “You should understand the case when<a href="#fn567" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref567" role="doc-noteref"><sup>567</sup></a> the sense of sight and perception of sight cease, […] the mind and mental perceptions cease.” Likewise, the inspired utterance becomes:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§143</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>Mendicants, there is a case when there is no earth, no water, no fire, no air; no state of unbounded space, no state of unbounded consciousness, no state of nothingness, no state of neither awareness nor nonawareness; no this world, no other world, no sun, no moon. Then, I tell you, there is no arriving, no departing, no abiding, no passing on, and no rebirth. It is with nothing planted, not moving on, without foundation. Just that is the end of suffering.<a href="#fn568" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref568" role="doc-noteref"><sup>568</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Now this no longer sounds like a state of existence. It instead tells us it is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">possible</span> to end all the things that are listed.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The passage may well be playing with multiple connotations of the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span>. It is worth recalling that the passage is an inspired utterance. The Buddha used many inspiring terms for the end of suffering: the island, the other shore, the shelter, and so forth. None of these are meant to be taken literally. Enlightened beings don’t go to a real island or shelter. Likewise, they don’t go to a literal ‘region’, ‘realm’, or ‘abode’: other ways to translate <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> in certain contexts.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>On a related note, similar claims of transcendent existence have been made based on the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span>, but these can be questioned in a similar fashion. Venerable Brahmāli explained: “Sometimes <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbāna</span> is called <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbānadhātu</span> […]. The word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span> is often translated as ‘element’. Basing one’s understanding on this translation it is natural to conclude that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbāna</span> must be ‘something’. However, this would be to ignore the range of meanings of the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span>.”<a href="#fn569" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref569" role="doc-noteref"><sup>569</sup></a> Dictionaries include under <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span>, “a principle […] sometimes a very general abstraction: -hood; -ness” and “condition, principle, property”.<a href="#fn570" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref570" role="doc-noteref"><sup>570</sup></a> As an illustration of these meanings, there is the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nirodhadhātu</span>, ‘the principle/property of cessation’. In a discourse specifically called the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Dhātu Sutta</span>, this <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nirodhadhātu</span> is a synonym for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>.<a href="#fn571" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref571" role="doc-noteref"><sup>571</sup></a> So in this context the word <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dhātu</span> simply refers to cessation, just like <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">āyatana</span> in the inspired utterance. It too does not refer to a state of existence.</p>
</div>
<h2 id='CHAP-SECTION-01-Just-that-is-the-end-of-suffering'>Just that is the end of suffering</h2>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The list of negations in the inspired utterance concludes, “<span data-custom-style="Emphasis">just that</span> is the end of suffering”. This indicates <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span> is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">just</span> the end of all things mentioned in the utterance, not something apart from them. A similar statement is made about enlightenment:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§144</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-line-block">
<p>They who have gone beyond doubt,<br>
in whom no sensual desires reside,<br>
in whom no craving can be found,<br>
their deliverance is <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">nothing more than that</span>.<a href="#fn572" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref572" role="doc-noteref"><sup>572</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>In other words, enlightenment is merely the ending of the defilements, not the creation or uncovering of something else. Likewise, the end of suffering is just the end of existence, not a transcendental state of existence or a type of consciousness. As the discourses say: “Extinguishment is the cessation of existence”,<a href="#fn573" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref573" role="doc-noteref"><sup>573</sup></a> with ‘extinguishment’ here meaning the final extinguishment that happens at death. It is the <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">ending</span> of things, not some form of continuation or creation.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>To explain this further, let me address all the things that are negated in the inspired utterance. Much of what we have discussed before is referred to as well.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘No earth, no water, no fire, no air’ refers to the cessation of existence in the material realms like the human one, but also includes the higher realms of mind-made form. Ancient Indians thought differently about the “material” universe than we do. The elements were believed to extend beyond what we now call matter, and included realms imperceptible to the five physical senses. Included in this are also mental perceptions of “bounded” space, perceptions of any form whatsoever.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘No state of unbounded space, no state of unbounded consciousness, no state of nothingness, no state of neither awareness nor nonawareness’ are the so-called formless states. The Buddha still experienced these before he passed away, which is one indication the inspired utterance is not about the living enlightened being but about <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>, the final cessation of suffering.<a href="#fn574" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref574" role="doc-noteref"><sup>574</sup></a> In line with the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Anāthapiṇḍika Sutta</span>, the utterance does not include the cessation of awareness and what is experienced (or ‘the cessation of perception and feeling’) in the things that don’t exist after <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span>. That is because <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">parinibbāna</span> is a permanent version of this cessation. This cessation of awareness is elsewhere also implied to be the highest bliss, even though nothing is experienced there, and in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Anupada Sutta</span> Venerable Sāriputta concluded there is no escape beyond it.<a href="#fn575" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref575" role="doc-noteref"><sup>575</sup></a></p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘No this world, no other world’ means no existence in this world or any other.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘No sun, no moon’ does sound a bit Brahmanical<a href="#fn576" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref576" role="doc-noteref"><sup>576</sup></a> and could have various meanings. It can simply mean not being in the world anymore. It might also refer to the absence of light, which can be seen as a metaphor for the absence of awareness. The absence of sunlight and moonlight could describe the cessation of consciousness, just like the simile of the fading beam of sunlight and the simile of the oil lamp at <a href="#bqseg104"><span data-custom-style="Hyperlink">§104</span></a>.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘No arriving, no departing, no abiding, no passing on, no rebirth’ stands for the end of rebirth. Most of these terms were explained in the discussion of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Seeds Discourse</span>. ‘No abiding’ is new, but it simply means no abiding in any state of existence, there being no abode for consciousness.</p>
</div></li>
<li><div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>‘Not moving on’ (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appavatta</span>) refers to the end of rebirth too, to the cessation of the cycle of rebirth.</p>

<p>‘Without foundation’ and ‘with nothing planted’ may have various implications, but these terms do remind us of the simile of the seed of consciousness.

</div>
<h1 id='CHAPTER-14.-Conclusion'>14. Conclusion</h1>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Although the primary aim of this book was to explain <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> and how it relates to Dependent Arising, I also tried to illustrate the beauty of the Blessed One’s teachings. There are many layers in his sermons, which use definitions, questions, and logic, and also make ample use of similes.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Buddha’s similes are sometimes misunderstood, but that is understandable. Aside from his teachings being profound, it is a natural byproduct of being separated in time, language, and culture. The Muslim philosopher Al-Farabi wrote in the first half of the tenth century: “Aristotle, when he laid down these matters in his books, expressed them by means of words customary among the people of his language, and used examples that were familiar to and current among the people of his day. But since the explanations of the people of this [Arabic] language are not customary to the people of that land [i.e., Greece], and the examples of the people of this time […] are different from the examples familiar to those [Greeks], the points which Aristotle intended to clarify by means of these examples have become unclear to and not understood by the people of our time.”<a href="#fn579" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref579" role="doc-noteref"><sup>579</sup></a> With the language and examples of the Buddha we find ourselves in a similar situation. But just like Al-Farabi aimed to clarify Aristotle, I hope my explanations and translations of the Buddha’s words have shed some light on some of his similes, so they can be understood by the people of our time.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>However, as hard as one might try, one aspect of these teachings that never comes across well in translation is the linguistic connections between various Pāli terms. A good example is <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">appatiṭṭhita</span>, which has relations to many phrases quoted in previous passages, among which:</p>

</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Let me close with a few thoughts on pragmatism.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Certain matters addressed in this work might seem to be minor textual details, of interest perhaps only to scholars. There is some truth in that, but the way the texts are understood is not without consequences for the practicing Buddhist. How we interpret the Buddha’s words strongly influences how we proceed on the path and how we look at our meditative experiences. The noble Teacher compared being well-versed and learned in his teachings to having many weapons with which to ward of the enemy (the enemy being the defilements).<a href="#fn591" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref591" role="doc-noteref"><sup>591</sup></a> We need not just access to weapons, however. We also need the knowledge of how to use them. If we know a lot of suttas but interpret them wrongly, it’s like fighting with the blunt end of a spear. We won’t be able to pierce anything. A spear held the wrong way round is more likely to harm the person wielding it instead.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>For many practitioners the focus on rebirth in Dependent Arising feels unpragmatic or unconfirmable, not visible in this life. This actually seems to be the most common objection against the general interpretation laid out here. But arguments based on subjectivity are, well… subjective! Don’t get me wrong; all power to those who do what’s pragmatic instead of theoretical. But when it comes to interpreting Dependent Arising, the Buddha’s famous exchange with Ānanda seems relevant:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-named-section">
<p>§146</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p><span id="bqseg146" class="anchor"></span>“Venerable Sir, it’s incredible; it’s unbelievable! This Dependent Arising appears deep and is deep, yet to me it seems as clear as clear can be.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Don’t say so, Ānanda! This Dependent Arising appears deep and is deep. It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching that this population is entangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, weaved like rushes, and does not leave behind the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the nether world, and transmigration.”<a href="#fn592" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref592" role="doc-noteref"><sup>592</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Dependent Arising is deep, so it may not be prudent to base one’s understanding of it on what appears practical. The common accusation that the multiple-lifetime interpretation cannot be verified through direct experience likewise is very unimaginative.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>It comes as no surprise to me that, while the multiple-lifetime interpretation is widely accepted with only minor disagreements, alternative takes on Dependent Arising that claim to be more pragmatic and verifiable vary greatly, each teacher suggesting something different which they apparently find to be more useful and within the possible scope of experience. If, on the other hand, you understand the words in this book on a theoretical level but fail to see how they apply to your own life or practice, then I think I actually did a great job of explaining what the Buddha was actually on about: something that is profoundly hard to see.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>I can understand why Ānanda said Dependent Arising was as clear as day to <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">him</span>, though. As a stream winner he had an insight that, when it happens, seems so obvious, you can’t help but wonder how you missed it for so long. I therefore think the Buddha’s rebuke, “don’t say so”, did not intend to say it wasn’t clear to Ānanda. It primarily meant to discourage him from thinking it should be clear to <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">others</span> who, as the Buddha says, unlike him are still fully stuck in low births and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>. Although Ānanda still had to develop a deeper understanding of Dependent Arising (which arguably could be a secondary reason for the Buddha’s rebuke), as a stream winner he already escaped the lower realms and found the basic way out of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">saṁsāra</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>One of the most profound descriptions of right view in the Pāli Canon says the noble ones know transmigration has no discernible beginning.<a href="#fn593" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref593" role="doc-noteref"><sup>593</sup></a> Let me repeat that. They <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">know</span> transmigration has no discernible beginning. For them it is not just a theory or something taken on faith. This insight is called their faculty of understanding (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">paññā</span>). They also know that whatever future lives they may still have, it all will come to an end. As the Buddha put it: <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Yaṁ kiñci sam­udaya­dhammaṁ, sabbaṁ taṁ nirodha­dhammaṁ</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">,</span> “whatever may arise, it is all bound to cease.”<a href="#fn594" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref594" role="doc-noteref"><sup>594</sup></a> This famous statement is widely acknowledged to be an insight unique to the noble ones, but it is not as well-known that it only <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">applies</span> to them as well. For everyone else suffering doesn’t cease, that’s the thing! For most people it’s just the arising sequence of Dependent Arising happening again and again. But the noble ones, having removed a huge chunk of ignorance, have irreversibly set the cessation sequence in motion. They also know for a fact that all suffering <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">is</span> going to end, that there are only a limited amount of lives left. This is how Dependent Arising and its cessation are directly visible: by knowing the past and the future right here and now, understanding how rebirth was brought about and how it will end.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Such insights will reshape all one’s aims and perspectives. When like Ānanda you see without a shadow of a doubt the reality of rebirth and its cessation, as clearly as if someone was shouting it right in your ear, all suffering inside this single life becomes irrelevant in comparison. Then it is no longer surprising the Buddha in his most profound teachings did not focus on that type of suffering—which to a large extent is unpreventable anyway, since you’re already born—but instead on the suffering of repeated birth and death. Being told these teachings are not pragmatic, will feel like being asked why you aren’t concerned with a scratch on your knee when you just found out you have cancer (and that everybody else has it too). You’ll disregard that person and consult your oncologist instead.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Our oncologist is the Buddha, who continually reminded us that we should not ignore the tumor of rebirth and existence. He even said <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">enlightened beings</span> should look at the aspects of existence as a tumor—and I mean literally—and this includes consciousness.<a href="#fn595" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref595" role="doc-noteref"><sup>595</sup></a> So if we think they experience some sort of unestablished consciousness and therefore don’t suffer, we are not really seeing the problem. And if we find in the suttas an everlasting consciousness, then we ignore the disease even more. We will fail to look at what the Buddha was pointing to and interpret our meditative experiences wrongly. Our attachment to existence may make us believe certain states of calm awareness we experienced are the highest peace. It can be very challenging to let go of such blissful experiences and acknowledge that they are still impermanent and conditioned. But according to the Buddha, if you wish to reach the end of suffering, that is exactly what you’ll have to do.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>How all that is done, and how it can be done joyfully, was not the subject of this writing. But I want to finish by saying that through deep meditation and reflection you <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">can</span> realize all these things. That discovery will open up a beautiful path towards enlightenment. It is the insight of the stream winners, for whom reflecting on Dependent Arising becomes the “noble method” to end suffering.<a href="#fn596" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref596" role="doc-noteref"><sup>596</sup></a> Only they, the noble ones, truly understand the deeper truths these teachings point at. May the Buddha’s words in this book bring you a little closer to this insight, and thereafter to the complete end of suffering.</p>
