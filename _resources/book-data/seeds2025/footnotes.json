By this I mean the actual principles existing in nature, rather than the Buddha’s teachings <em>on</em> these principles, which I call ‘Dependent Arising’.</p><p>The term is sometimes translated as ‘dependent <em>co</em>arising’, but the prefix <span lang='pi'>saṁ</span>- in <span lang='pi'>sam&shy;up&shy;pāda</span> is simply a redundancy for the following prefix up- (=<span lang='pi'>ud</span>-). As <span class='sesame biblioref'>PED</span> says under <span lang='pi'>saṁ</span>-: “very often merely pleonastic, esp. in comb[inatio]n with other prefixes.” Therefore, under <span lang='pi'>samuppajjati</span> it simply has, “to arise, to be produced”. No other dictionary suggests ‘coarising’ either.

We do not speak of a coarising of sickness or wealth, nor does there seem to be a good justification, certainly not on a linguistic basis, to speak of a coarising of death, for instance. <span lang='pi'>Samupajjati</span> is simply a synonym for <span lang='pi'>upajjati</span>, including in the context of Dependent Arising. There is also no such thing as “<span lang='pi'>saṁ-nirodha</span>” (“co-cessation”) but only <span lang='pi'>nirodha</span> (cessation), which indicates “co-” is not intended in <span lang='pi'>sam&shy;up&shy;pāda</span> either. See also <span class='sesame biblioref'>Jones 2021</span> p.234: “When translating the expression <span lang='pi'>paṭicca-samuppāda</span> in the Pāli Canon, it therefore seems inappropriate to use words like ‘coarising’ or ‘co-production’.” <span class='sesame biblioref'>Schmithausen 1997</span> n.73 similarly concluded: “It is not probable that the prefix <span lang='pi'>saṁ</span>- was, from the outset, intended to convey such a heavy meaning.”</p>"

    "fnHTML": "<p><span lang='pi'>Imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti</span>, ‘There will be this (<span lang='pi'>idaṁ hoti</span>), only if there is that (<span lang='pi'>imasmiṁ sati</span>)’. The clause <span lang='pi'>imasmiṁ sati</span> forms a locative absolute. There have been discussions whether this implies that the factors of Dependent Arising happen simultaneously or whether it allows for a separation in time (e.g. <span class='sesame biblioref'>Brahmavamso 2002</span>). But this misses the fact that the locative absolute, although it can have temporal connotations, can also form a conditional. <span class='sesame biblioref'>Wijesekera 1993</span> §184 states: “the temporal notion is not the only idea expressed by the loc[ative] absolute. […] It may also signify a condition that exists or should exist for the fulfillment of the main action, which may be rendered by such expressions as ‘if, on condition, provided that’ etc.” See also <span class='sesame biblioref'>Duroiselle</span> §603 iii: “<span lang='pi'>Sati</span>, the locative singular of <span lang='pi'>santo</span> […] may also often be translated by ‘if, such being the case’.” This conditional meaning applies here. The clause <span lang='pi'>imasmiṁ sati</span> describes a general principle of dependency without any temporal implications.</p><p>By “a condition that exists or should exist” Wijesekera means the locative absolute can denote either a sufficient or a necessary condition. A necessary condition can be indicated with ‘provided that’, as Wijesekera suggests, but also with ‘only if’, as I have done. It is a subtle difference, but I think <span lang='pi'>imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti</span> should not be translated as “there will be this if there is that” (omitting ‘only’), because this forms a sufficient condition, and sufficiency does not apply to all the links—yet this statement is individually applied to all links, as in §11.</p><p>To give a general example first, “there will be rain <em>if</em> there are clouds” would mean it always rains whenever there are clouds. Clouds are sufficient for rain. However, “there will be rain <em>only</em> if there are clouds”, just means it cannot rain without clouds. Clouds are necessary for rain. In the context of Dependent Arising “there will be craving <em>if</em> there are sensations” would mean there will be craving whenever there are sensations. Sensations would be sufficient for craving. This is incorrect, because enlightened beings still experience sensations yet don’t have craving, and even when you’re not enlightened, you can experience sensations without craving, like in deep meditation. However, the translation “there will be craving <em>only</em> if there are sensations” instead means sensations are just a necessary condition for craving. Likewise, birth is not a sufficient condition for old age, since beings can die young. So there will be old age <em>only</em> if there is birth, not <em>if</em> there is birth. Or, if in §83 we were to translate the mutual dependency between consciousness and the immaterial aspects and body as “there will be the immaterial aspects and body <em>if</em> there is consciousness [and] there will be consciousness <em>if</em> there are the immaterial aspects and body”, we would technically say that the two factors keep each other in existence, since there are two statements of sufficiency. However, “there will the immaterial aspects and body <em>only</em> if there is consciousness [and] there will be consciousness <em>only</em> if there are the immaterial aspects and body” leaves room for ignorance and willful actions to also be required. This mutual dependency is of course exactly what the simile of the bundles of reeds portrays (§95). The idea is that one bundle can stand <em>only</em> if the other stands; not that <em>if</em> one stands, the other also stands automatically.</p><p>Furthermore, if the links in Dependent Arising were translated as sufficient conditions (that is, using ‘if’ instead of ‘only if’) technically there could also be other sufficient conditions that lead to the same results. For example, willful actions could then logically have been the result of something other than ignorance—knowledge, let’s say. For it would then be possible to say: “There will be willful actions if there is ignorance, <em>and</em> there will be willful actions if there is knowledge.” With ‘only if’ this does not work (as it shouldn’t): “There will be willful actions only if there is ignorance, and there will be willful actions only if there is knowledge.” The two statements conflict, because they are necessary conditions with opposing requirements. The whole point of the sequence of dependent arising is that all links are necessary conditions. Otherwise suffering could technically have been brought about through something other than ignorance.</p><p>The underlying issue is, this difference between ‘if’ and ‘only if’ does not exist in Pāli. The locative absolute can be translated as either, depending on the context. However, the context of Dependent Arising demands the latter. It demands necessary conditions. See also <span class='sesame biblioref'>Jayatilleke</span> p.449 on this phrase: “B does not occur unless A is present and occurs <em>only</em> when A is present.” (emphasis added)</p>"

    "fnHTML": "<p>More literally, ‘dependency (<span lang='pi'>paccayatā</span>) on something (<span lang='pi'>idap</span>)’. The term <span lang='pi'>idap&shy;pac&shy;cay&shy;atā</span> is sometimes translated as ‘causality’, which may work too. However, to many people ‘to cause’ means “to actively produce as a result” (Wiktionary.com s.v. ‘cause’)—think of billiard balls bouncing against one another—and in context of Dependent Arising this kind of causality does not always apply. Birth does not actively produce death, for example. It is heart attacks and car crashes that do so, arguably. Neither do sensations actively produce craving: it is ignorance that does. Also, consciousness and <span lang='pi'>nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span>, which are mutually dependent, do not cause one another in an active way. They just rely on one another, as the simile of the reeds at §95 illustrates, both being in a sense “actively produced” by willful actions. <span class='sesame biblioref'>Jones 2022</span> p.135 agreed: “To understand them as a causal sequence, whereby ignorance is the cause of the inherited conditioning factors (<span lang='pi'>saṅ&shy;khā&shy;rā</span>), feeling (<span lang='pi'>vedanā</span>) is the cause of craving, birth is the cause of ageing and death, and so on, leads to obscurity and contradiction. But to understand each of these conditionally-arisen phenomena as necessary and sometimes sufficient conditions for the arising of the next in the sequence allows for interpretations that are truer to the teachings.”</p><p>In everyday contexts the words <span lang='pi'>paṭicca</span> and <span lang='pi'>paccaya</span> also do not indicate what we normally call ‘causes’. It is said that the body depends on (<span lang='pi'>paṭicca</span>) food, and will die without it. (<span class='sclinktext'>SN&#8239;46.2<span class='scsegments'>:1.2</span></span>) Food is not the <em>cause</em> of the body: it is just one condition necessary for its continuance. In context of Dependent Arising itself, the <span class='sesame'>Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving</span> mentions that fire depends on (<span lang='pi'>paṭicca</span>) fuel. (§102) Fuel by itself does not really <em>cause</em> fire either. As to <span lang='pi'>paccaya</span>, a noble disciple is said to be ‘not dependent on others’ (<span lang='pi'>aparappaccaya</span>). These and other everyday uses of the words also indicate that Dependent Arising is about dependencies, not causalities, at least not in the way the word ‘cause’ is sometimes understood.</p><p>The word <span lang='pi'>nidāna</span> is sometimes also translated as ‘cause’, particularly in the title of the <span data-sesame-key='dn-blurbs:dn15' class='sesame'>Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, then called ‘The Great Discourse on Causality’. But a common translation for the word itself is ‘source’, which I think is more accurate. See for example <span class='sesame biblioref'>Sujato 2023</span> at <span class='sclinktext'>AN&#8239;3.34</span>, <span class='sesame'>Nidāna Sutta</span>, titled ‘Sources’. As another example, discourses stemming from Sāvatthi are called <span lang='pi'>Sāvatthi-nidānaṁ</span>. In this light, the <span data-sesame-key='dn-blurbs:dn15' class='sesame'>Mahānidāna Sutta</span> should be called something like ‘The Great Discourse on the Sources [of things]’, although that definitely doesn’t sound as good. <span class='sesame biblioref'>Schmithausen 2000</span> calls it the Great Discourse on the Underlying Factors (<em>Großen Lehrrede von den zugrundeliegenden Factoren</em>). In this book I just refer to the discourse by its Pāli name.</p><p>All that said, ‘causality’ is not wrong per se. There are various ways to define the term, some of which do not differ much from dependency, if at all. Pragmatically the difference between the two may have limited relevance as well, because whether we say death <em>depends</em> on birth or death is <em>caused</em> by birth, the fundamental problem remains the same. Many of the links are also causal no matter how we interpret it. I also use the word ‘cause’ in the main text, although in the translations I stuck to ‘condition’ for <span lang='pi'>hetu</span> and ‘requirement’ for <span lang='pi'>paccaya</span>. The words have a range of meaning that does not match a single English word, so these translations are not applicable throughout the canon, but they do work in the present context.</p>"

Since there is a <span lang='pi'>peyalla</span> (…) here, it may have been repeated once too many times by the reciter, accidentally adding the aggregate of consciousness. The addition of consciousness also does not add much pragmatic value, since sensation, perception, and consciousness are intrinsically connected (§99), so any desire for consciousness will be accompanied by a desire for sensation and perception.</p>"

Both <span lang='pi'>anabhisaṅkhāraṁ</span> (not willing) and <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;mut&shy;taṁ</span> (liberated) could be taken as adjectives of <span lang='pi'>viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span>. However:</p><p>(1) Consciousness as one of the <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span> is just aware of things, it does not do things nor stop doing things at enlightenment, so ‘not willing’ would likely not be said of it.</p><p>(2) The before is about how consciousness comes to cease when “its foundation is destroyed”, not about liberating it.</p><p>(3) Although <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> can be a near synonym for the mind (<span lang='pi'>citta</span>), the two words are still used in different senses, and elsewhere in the Nikāyas it is always either the mind or the person that is said to be liberated, never <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span>.</p><p>(4) <span class='sclinktext'>SN&#8239;22.45</span> &amp; <span class='sclinktext'>SN&#8239;22.46</span> share their closing paragraph with this sutta, and there it is nmistakably the mind that is liberated.</p><p>For these reasons I think the mind is intended in this sutta as well. I take <span lang='pi'>ca</span> (and) to indicate there to be two separate sentences: <span lang='pi'>Tadappatiṭṭhitaṁ viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ avirūḷhaṁ. Anabhisaṅkhārañ-ca vi&shy;mut&shy;taṁ</span>. Seeing the first part as a full sentence is supported by <span class='sclinktext'>SN&#8239;12.38<span class='scsegments'>:3.3</span></span>, <span class='sclinktext'>SN&#8239;12.38<span class='scsegments'>:3.3</span></span> &amp; <span class='sclinktext'>SN&#8239;12.40<span class='scsegments'>:3.3</span></span>, where <span lang='pi'>tadappatiṭṭhite viññāṇe avirūḷhe</span> is an absolute, hence a separately functioning clause; and seeing the second as a separate sentence makes it match the other two-word sentences that follow. The translation thus becomes: “Not planted, consciousness will not sprout. And not creating, ‘it’ is liberated.” The ‘it’ refers to the mind, like in the common phrase <span lang='pi'>vimuttasmiṁ ‘vimuttam’iti ñāṇaṁ hoti</span>, “when liberated, there is the knowledge ‘it [the mind] is liberated’.” Previous translators similarly separated <span lang='pi'>viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span> from <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;mut&shy;taṁ</span> in the <span class='sesame'>Seeds Discourse</span> (see <span data-custom-style='internal-reference'>note 504</span>). <span class='sesame biblioref'>Nyanaponika 1990</span> has “<span data-custom-style='wwc-german'>ist man befreit</span>”, meaning “<em>one</em> is liberated”. But <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;mut&shy;taṁ</span> being neuter, ‘the mind’ is preferable over ‘one’, which would require the masculine.</p><p>The Chinese parallel at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sa39' class='extlink'>SĀ 39</a> also supports the separation of consciousness and liberation, as it disjoints the two with a set of phrases not found in the Pāli. <span class='sesame biblioref'>Anālayo 2014</span> translated: “The basis being abandoned, that consciousness is not established anywhere and does not grow further and increase. Because of not growing, there is no creating of formations. Not creating formations, one is steady. Being steady, one is contented. Being contented, one is released.” So again the Chinese, as in <span data-custom-style='internal-reference'>note 277</span> and <span data-custom-style='internal-reference'>note 278</span>, seems more on point than the Pāli.</p>"

The quoted words are not literal thoughts, and therefore do not have to be translated as a literal quote. <span lang='pi'>Idaṁ</span> is a pronoun without explicit referent, meaning it does not refer to any specific noun, including <span lang='pi'>nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span> (contra e.g. <span class='sesame biblioref'>Ñāṇananda 2015</span> p.132). See the prose preceding these verses in the discourse, where <span lang='pi'>idaṁ</span> also does not refer to anything specific: “What the world […] considers to be the truth (‘<span lang='pi'>idaṁ saccan’ti upanijjhāyitaṁ</span>), the noble ones […] understand to be false. […] What the world […] considers to be false (<span lang='pi'>‘idaṁ musā’ti upanijjhāyitaṁ</span>), the noble ones […] understand to be the truth.” There is no mention of <span lang='pi'>nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span> at this point. Furthermore, if <span lang='pi'>idaṁ</span> <em>were</em> to refer to <span lang='pi'>nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span> here, then the noble ones also understand it to be true. This does not fit Ñāṇananda’s ideas, who took <span lang='pi'>nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span> to be an intrinsically deluded cognition, “a product of imagination”. Instead, these are more general statements about what is taken to be true and false, not referring to anything specific.</p><p>The same idea applies to the common phrase <span lang='pi'>idam’eva saccaṁ</span>, for example in <span lang='pi'>sassato loko, idam’eva saccaṁ</span>, ‘the world is eternal, just this is the truth’— e.g. <span class='sclinktext'>DN&#8239;9<span class='scsegments'>:25.3</span></span> <span class='ptsref'>PTS: D I 187</span>. <span lang='pi'>Idaṁ</span> is neuter, while <span lang='pi'>loko</span> is masculine, so the former does not refer to the latter. Put differently, ‘the world’ is not considered to be ‘the truth’: it is the entire statement ‘the world is eternal’ which is taken as truth. Likewise, in the discourse at hand, <span lang='pi'>nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span> is not the thing that is considered to be the truth. It is its <em>selfhood</em> which is mistakenly taken as truth, as the commentary also notes, not <span lang='pi'>nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span> itself. The world imagining (<span lang='pi'>maññati</span>) things to be true refers back to the earlier line on them imagining <span lang='pi'>nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span> to have a self (<span lang='pi'>atta-māniṁ</span>). It also corresponds with the next line: “for whatever they imagine it is [i.e. a self], it is different from that [i.e. without a self].” (See also the passage quoted at <span data-custom-style='internal-reference'>note 422</span>: “The Buddha has said to not identify with the attainment of the first <span lang='pi'>jhāna</span>. For whatever you imagine it is, it is different from that.”)</p>"

The commentary only comments on the figurative meaning, but Venerable Ṭhānissaro translated the line as ‘making an abode in name &amp; form’, which given the preceding prose seems well-justified. The following two verses refer to rebirth and its ending as well.</p>"
