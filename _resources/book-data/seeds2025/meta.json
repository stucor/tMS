			"ShortAbstract" : "<p>Dependent Arising is one of the Buddha’s most important and central doctrines, but in recent decades it has been interpreted in a large variety of ways. This book illustrates that the early Buddhist texts support the traditional multiple-lifetime interpretation of this teaching, taking a particular interest in the factor of consciousness. Centered around three similes, it connects this factor to rebirth and explains how it relates to the other factors of Dependent Arising. It also explains that <span lang='pi'>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, a term used in the similes, refers to the cessation of consciousness.</p>",
