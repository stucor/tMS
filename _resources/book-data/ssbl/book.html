<p>One of the most common unquestioned assumptions among Buddhist meditators is that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> is synonymous with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vipassanā</span>. This assumption, it seems, often is a result of reading the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> in isolation without carefully considering the context in which <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> is used throughout the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>. When the broader view of the entire <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sutta Piṭaka</span> is taken into account, it becomes clear that such an assumption is, at best, only partially correct.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> In this short study I will investigate the various contexts in which <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> appear and in particular consider its relationship with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<h1 id='CHAPTER-Samādhi-and-the-Satipaṭṭhāna-Suttas'>Samādhi and the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas</h1>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas are often understood as being only concerned with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vipassanā</span> meditation. But there is nothing intrinsic to the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas that allows one to conclude thus. Indeed, there are several aspects of these <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> that point to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> also being concerned with <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samatha</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>, calm and stillness.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The first of these aspects is the inclusion of the first tetrad of the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Ānāpānasati Sutta</span> in the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p><span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">Ānāpānasati</span> is usually regarded as a <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> practice, and there seems to be no reason why it should be regarded otherwise here.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Moreover, the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Ānāpānasati Sutta</span> states that each of its four tetrads fulfils each of the four <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhānas</span>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> It then concludes:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Bhikkhus, that is how mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, fulfils the four <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhānas</span>.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>And it is not only the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ānāpānasati</span> part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas which relates to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. The cemetery contemplations, for example, are elsewhere specifically said to be <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> practices:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“And, monks, what is the effort of guarding? Here, monks, a monk guards a favourable object of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> which is present in him: the perception of a skeleton, the perception of a worm-infested corpse, the perception of a livid corpse, the perception of a festering corpse, the perception of a fissured corpse, the perception of a bloated corpse.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Indeed, it seems that all the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> practices have a <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> aspect. Take the standard passage which concludes each exercise of the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“In this way he contemplates an aspect of the body internally, or he contemplates an aspect of the body externally, or he contemplates an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … phenomena internally and externally.”<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Then consider the following passage which relates the internal contemplation directly to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Here a monk contemplates an aspect of the body internally, energetic, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed desire and aversion for the world.

<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The above should be sufficient to at least suggest that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> is an integral part of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span>. However, to be able to make a strong case for this relationship, and to consider in more detail what it involves, it is necessary to look beyond the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas to the broader use of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-sesame">Sutta Piṭaka</span>.</p>

<h1 id='CHAPTER-Satipaṭṭhāna-and-Vipassanā'>Satipaṭṭhāna and Vipassanā</h1>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>The above survey presents the most important evidence on the context in which <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> occurs throughout the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>. Having thus shown that the usual purpose of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> is the attainment of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>, it is necessary to consider the relationship between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vipassanā</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Firstly, it should be noted that the prevalence of a direct link between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> does not necessarily mean that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> is all about <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samatha</span> meditation. Rather, it means that, whether one practices <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samatha</span> or <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vipassanā</span>, in both cases the purpose of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> is the attainment of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Secondly, the question arises as to what happens after <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>: is there such a thing as post-<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span>, and if so, what does it involve? In this context it is important to note that a number of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span> make it clear that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> practice can take one all the way to the end of the Buddhist Path, for example:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Bhikkhus, these four <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhānas</span>, when developed and cultivated, are noble and liberating; they lead one who acts upon them to the complete destruction of suffering.”<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>For <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> to be able to take one to full awakening, it seems required that it must include post-<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vipassanā</span>, i.e. deep insight.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> But a direct relationship between <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">vipassanā</span> is never explicitly mentioned in the <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">suttas</span>.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> To establish such a link it is necessary to broaden the inquiry to include other terms that also signify insight, such as <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ñāṇa</span>, <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dassana</span>, and <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">yathā</span>-<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhūta</span>-<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ñāṇa</span>-<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">dassana</span>. This broadened inquiry brings to light the following interesting passage:</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“Come, friends, contemplate an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … phenomena, energetic, clearly comprehending, unified, serene, stilled, with one-pointed mind, in order to know the body according to reality (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">yathā</span>-<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhūta</span>-<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ñāṇa</span>).”<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Note how this passage differs significantly from the standard <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> formula found almost everywhere else. It is two differences in particular that are important in the context of this study: Firstly, the insight aspect relates to the deep insights of seeing reality as it actually is (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">yathā</span>-<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">bhūta</span>-<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">ñāṇa</span>); secondly, using a string of related terms—unified, serene, stilled, with one-pointed mind—the passage puts a strong emphasis on <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. The implication is that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> should be practiced for the purpose of deep insight only after <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> has been achieved.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> It thus seems clear that there is such a thing as post-<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> and that its purpose is deep insight.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
</div>
<h1 id='CHAPTER-Two-Stages-of-Satipaṭṭhāna'>Two Stages of Satipaṭṭhāna</h1>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>From the above it emerges that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> normally should be considered as a practice leading to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> and under special circumstances as a practice leading to deep insight. Furthermore, it appears that these two aspects of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> can be divided into two quite distinct stages. In accordance with the natural progression of meditation practice,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> the first stage of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> is about attaining <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. Once <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span> has been achieved (i.e. the necessary condition for deep insight is in place), the mind is equipped to uncover the true nature of the five aspects of personality<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> and realise the successive stages of awakening. This is the second stage of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span>.

<div data-custom-style="WW-blockquote">
<p>“... so these four focuses of mindfulness (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span>) are the bindings for the mind of the noble disciple in order to subdue his habits from lay life, to subdue his distress, fatigue, and fever from lay life, and in order that he may attain the true way and realise extinguishment (<span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">nibbāna</span>).</p>

<h1 id='CHAPTER-Conclusion'>Conclusion</h1>
<div data-custom-style="WW-paragraph">
<p>Almost all <em>sutta</em> passages that deal with the place of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> in the broader scheme of the Buddhist path, show that <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> is a condition for <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>. It must therefore be concluded that the main purpose of <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">satipaṭṭhāna</span> is to bring the mind to <span data-custom-style="wwc-pali">samādhi</span>.
