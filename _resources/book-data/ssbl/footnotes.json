    "fnHTML": "<p>It would seem that “distress, fatigue, and fever based on lay life” refers to the five hindrances, in particular sense desire. The text in question, however, specifies that the five hindrances have already been removed. To make sense of this apparent contradiction, we need to turn to the parallel to <span class='sclinktext'>MN&#8239;125</span> found in the Madhyama Āgama in Chinese translation, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ma198/' class='extlink'>MĀ 198</a>. This parallel does in fact not include the five hindrances at this stage. Ven. Anālayo argues persuasively that certain elements of the Pali version, including the five hindrances, are corruptions that were not originally present. (See <span class='sesame biblioref'>Anālayo’s, A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, Taipei, 2011</span>, p.719.)</p><p>There are also other passages where <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> practice is shown to remove (refined aspects of) the hindrances:</p><p>I. “So too, monks, here some wise, competent, skilful monk contemplates an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … phenomena, energetic, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed desire and aversion for the world.

In the present passage, instead of the terms <span lang='pi'>ātāpī</span>, <span lang='pi'>sam&shy;pa&shy;jāno</span>, <span lang='pi'>satimā</span>, <span lang='pi'>vineyya</span> <span lang='pi'>loke</span> <span lang='pi'>ab&shy;hij&shy;jhā</span>-<span lang='pi'>dom&shy;an&shy;as&shy;saṁ</span> found in the ordinary <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> formula, we find <span lang='pi'>mā</span> ca <span lang='pi'>kā&shy;mū&shy;pa&shy;saṁ&shy;hi&shy;taṁ</span> <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;tak&shy;kaṁ</span> <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;tak&shy;kesi</span>.

Also in the present passage, in the subsequent text the first jhāna is missing, the training going straight to the second jhāna.
