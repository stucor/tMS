			"ShortAbstract" : "<p>One of the most common unquestioned assumptions among Buddhist meditators is that <span lang='pi'>satipaṭṭhāna</span> is synonymous with <span lang='pi'>vipassanā</span>. This assumption, it seems, often is a result of reading the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas in isolation without carefully considering the context in which <span lang='pi'>satipaṭṭhāna</span> is used throughout the suttas. When the broader view of the entire Sutta Piṭaka is taken into account, it becomes clear that such an assumption is, at best, only partially correct. In this short study I will investigate the various contexts in which <span lang='pi'>satipaṭṭhāna</span> appear and in particular consider its relationship with <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>.</p>",
