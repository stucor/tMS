			"ShortAbstract" : "<p>A wide range of opinions has long surrounded two innocent Pali words: <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa anidassana</span>. They are translated variously, as ‘consciousness that is without feature / signless / invisible / non-manifesting / makes no showing / can not be characterized’, et cetera. This variety already indicates that their meaning is somewhat obscure. This obscurity has, however, not stopped interpreters from giving the words a lot of importance, because some see in <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa anidassana</span> a kind of consciousness essentially equal to nibbāna. But there are many problems with this. Bhikkhu Sunyo examines these problems and discusses why <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa anidassana</span> is not nibbāna, but rather it is the state of boundless consciousness, the second “formless” meditation state.</p>",
