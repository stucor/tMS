  {"id":"Bodhi 1995a","abstract":"This book offers a complete translation of the Majjhima Nikāya, or Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, one of the major collections of texts in the Pali Canon, the authorized scriptures of Theravāda Buddhism. This collection—among the oldest records of the historical Buddha’s original teachings—consists of 152 suttas or discourses of middle length, distinguished as such from the longer and shorter suttas of the other collections. The Majjhima Nikāya might be concisely described as the Buddhist scripture that combines the richest variety of contextual settings with the deepest and most comprehensive assortment of teachings. These teachings, which range from basic ethics to instructions in meditation and liberating insight, unfold in a fascinating procession of scenarios that show the Buddha in living dialogue with people from many different strata of ancient Indian society: with kings and princes, priests and ascetics, simple villagers and erudite philosophers. Replete with drama, reasoned argument, and illuminating parable and simile, these discourses exhibit the Buddha in the full glory of his resplendent wisdom, majestic sublimity, and compassionate humanity.\n\nThe translation is based on an original draft translation left by the English scholar-monk Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli, which has been edited and revised by the American monk Bhikkhu Bodhi, who provides a long introduction and helpful explanatory notes. Combining lucidity of expression with accuracy, this translation enables the Buddha to speak across twenty-five centuries in language that addresses the most pressing concerns of the contemporary reader seeking clarification of the timeless issues of truth, value, and the proper conduct of life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ñāṇamoli","given":"Bhikkhu"},{"family":"Bodhi","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"call-number":"Contents, Preface, Introduction & Summary of Suttas","citation-key":"Bodhi 1995a","event-place":"Boston","file":"Ñāṇamoli_Bodhi_1995_The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha.pdf","ISBN":"978-0-86171-072-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"1424","publisher":"Wisdom Publications","publisher-place":"Boston","title":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A new translation of the Majjhima Nikāya","type":"book","URL":"https://wisdomexperience.org/product/middle-length-discourses-buddha/"},
  {"id":"Brahmali 2009a","abstract":"The only way of moving towards consensus on the controversial subject of the nature of Nibbana is by appealing to the sole source of authority common to practically all Buddhists: the Nikayas/Agamas. In the present paper I will first give an overview of the usage of the term Nibbana in the Nikayas. I will then argue that, according to the Nikayas, Nibbana cannot be regarded as a self. Next, I will point out that the Nikayas do not see Nibbana as a form of consciousness, including such exceptional kinds of consciousness as anidassana viññana and appatitthita viññana. Nor can Nibbana be regarded as equivalent to mind, or any particular state of mind. In the final section I aim to show that the most reasonable interpretation of the Nikayas is that final Nibbana is no more than the cessation of the five khandhas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Brahmāli","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"call-number":"Original 2009","citation-key":"Brahmali 2009a","container-title":"Buddhist Studies Review","DOI":"10.1558/bsrv.v26i1.33","file":"Brahmāli_2009_What the Nikayas Say and Do not Say about Nibbana.pdf","ISSN":"1747-9681","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,8,22]]},"language":"en","page":"33-66","source":"journal.equinoxpub.com","title":"What the Nikayas Say and Do not Say about Nibbana","title-short":"niknib","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSR/article/view/8891","volume":"26"},
