  {"id":"AliD 2004a","abstract":"Scholars have long studied classical Sanskrit culture in almost total isolation from its courtly context. This book focuses exclusively on the royal court as a social and cultural institution. Using both literary and inscriptional sources, it begins with the rise and spread of royal households and political hierarchies from the Gupta period (c.350–750), and traces the emergence of a coherent courtly worldview which would remain stable for almost a millennium to 1200. Later chapters examine key features of courtly life such as: manners, ethics, concepts of personal beauty, and theories of disposition. The book ends with a sustained examination of the theory and practice of erotic love in the context of the wider social dynamics and anxieties which faced the people of the court.","author":[{"family":"Ali","given":"Daud"}],"citation-key":"AliD 2004a","collection-number":"10","collection-title":"Cambridge Studies in Indian History and Society","edition":"Illustrated edition","event-place":"Cambridge","file":"","ISBN":"978-0-521-81627-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"English","note":"IACode: courtlyculturepo0000alid","number-of-pages":"318","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","title":"Courtly Culture and Political Life in Early Medieval India","title-short":"Courtly Culture and Political Life in Early Medieval India","type":"book"},
  {"id":"AllenC 2008a","abstract":"This book offers a true account of the scandal that enveloped the discovery in 1898 of an inscribed cascet said to contain the ashes of the Buddha, set against the background of the high noon of the British Raj.In January 1898 a British landowner, William Claxton Peppe, excavated a large Buddhist brick stupa on his estate close to India's border with Nepal. At a depth of 24 feet he uncovered a huge stone coffer, within which were a number of reliquary vases together with a mass of jewels and gold offerings. The opening of the Piprahwa stupa followed on from the discovery nearby of the birthplace of the Buddha (Lumbini) and the legendary city (Kapilavastu) where he had grown into manhood as Prince Sidhartha, but what made this discovery so important was an inscription found on the top of one of the reliquary cascets - declaring it to contain ashes of the Buddha left there by members of his own Sakya clan.This news aroused world-wide interest, not least in the Buddhist world, since no other so well authenticated relics of the Buddha had ever been found. But almost immediately it became known that a German archaeologist, Dr Anton Fuhrer, working nearby at the same time had not only made bogus claims and faked his results but had also been associated with the dig. Fuhrer was quickly unmasked by a British magistrate who himself had a stake in the excavation.Renowned India expert Charles Allen tells the story, weaving in the results of a conference held at Harewood House in June 2006 on the validity of the Piprahwa dig and considering the results of recent carbon dating.","author":[{"family":"Allen","given":"Charles"}],"citation-key":"AllenC 2008a","edition":"UK First Edition","event-place":"London","file":"","ISBN":"978-1-905791-93-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",10,29]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"300","publisher":"Haus Publishing Limited","publisher-place":"London","title":"The Buddha and Dr Fuhrer: An Archaeological Scandal","title-short":"The Buddha and Dr Fuhrer","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Analayo 2018a","abstract":"Join a rigorous scholar and Buddhist monk on a brisk tour of rebirth from ancient doctrine to contemporary debates. German Buddhist monk and university professor Bhikkhu Analayo had not given much attention to the topic of rebirth before some friends asked him to explore the treatment of the issue in early Buddhist texts. This succinct volume presents his findings, approaching the topic from four directions. The first chapter examines the doctrine of rebirth as it is presented in the earliest Buddhist sources and the way it relates to core doctrinal principles. The second chapter reviews debates about rebirth throughout Buddhist history and up to modern times, noting the role of confirmation bias in evaluation of evidence. Chapter 3 reviews the merits of current research on rebirth, including near-death experience, past-life regression, and children who recall previous lives. The chapter concludes with an examination of xenoglossy, the ability to speak languages one has not learned previously, and chapter 4 examines the particular case of Dhammaruwan, a Sri Lankan boy who chants Pali texts that he does not appear to have learned in his present life. Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research brings together the many strands of the debate on rebirth in one place, making it both comprehensive and compact. It is not a polemic but an interrogation of the evidence, and it leaves readers to come to their own conclusions.","author":[{"family":"Analayo","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"citation-key":"Analayo 2018a","event-place":"Somerville, MA","file":"Analayo_2018_Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research.pdf","ISBN":"978-1-61429-446-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,24]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"296","publisher":"Wisdom Publications,U.S.","publisher-place":"Somerville, MA","title":"Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research","type":"book","URL":"https://wisdomexperience.org/product/rebirth-early-buddhism-and-current-research/"},

  {"id":"Analayo 2022b","abstract":"Various dimensions of the cultivation of mindfulness in its early Buddhist historical setting can be better appreciated in the light of their doctrinal background. One aspect of this doctrinal background is the ancient Indian tetralemma, which differs from the Aristotelian logic that has informed much of Western thought. The tetralemma proposes that, in addition to affirmation and denial, at times a particular situation may be more appropriately captured by a combination of both (partly yes and partly no). Or else, another situation may call for neither affirmation nor negation. Although at first sight the resultant fourfold perspective can appear puzzling, closer inspection shows this model of thought to have a considerable potential for countering mental rigidity and enabling the transcendence of binary thought patterns, thereby being perhaps relevant to research on the relationship between mindfulness and cognitive flexibility.","author":[{"family":"Anālayo","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"citation-key":"Analayo 2022b","container-title":"Mindfulness","container-title-short":"Mindfulness","DOI":"10.1007/s12671-021-01678-6","file":"Anālayo_2022_Beyond the Limitations of Binary Thinking.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Beyond the Limitations of Binary Thinking: Mindfulness and the Tetralemma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01678-6","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"Bausch 2015a","abstract":"This dissertation traces regional philosophy in religious texts, namely the Kāṇva Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Suttanipāta. Receiving the Vedas in the East, Yājñavalkya and the Vājasaneyins enlivened earlier Vedic concepts and augmented Vedic propensities for asceticism. The region of Kosala flourished during the lifetime of Śākyamuni Buddha, and as a result, the Kāṇva School formed an important part of the cultural milieu in which the historical Buddha lived. The Suttanipāta depicts the Buddha as knowledgeable in Vedic practices and lore and as interacting with brāhmaṇas, arguably both before and after a separate Buddhist identity formed. Considering this background, the relationship between late Vedic and early Buddhist thought must be reassessed. Because value is acquired and erased when concepts circulate, the Buddha’s teaching in the Suttanipāta can be considered a philosophical project to create new concepts and to translate practices that respond to a changing milieu.Through a close analysis of Yājñavalkya’s interpretation of the agnihotra and Sāvitrī ṛk as related to cognitive processes, this study uncovers the metaphysical meaning of philosophical concepts, such as svàr, vā́ja, dhī́, and prajā, etc. In particular, the dissertation demonstrates that Yājñavalkya’s concept of karma (rite) in the Kāṇva Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa implies what is called karmic retribution. Vedic concepts for the unmanifest govern the idea of karmic retribution and the goal of becoming cognizant of the inflow of unmanifest energy in conscious cognition. The Buddha again revitalizes these concepts when teaching a brāhmaṇa audience in the Suttanipāta. The Buddhist concepts of upadhi, āsava, crossing over to the far shore, and the serpent shedding his skin enliven earlier Vedic philosophy, which was expressed in systems of conceptual metaphors. In this way, Kosalan philosophy in the Kāṇva Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Suttanipāta advances theories of causality and two modes of knowing—one karmically conditioned by past actions (saṃjñā/saññā), and the other a direct knowing (prajñāna/paññā) unmediated by karmic retribution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Bausch","given":"Lauren Michelle"}],"citation-key":"Bausch 2015a","file":"Bausch_2015_Kosalan Philosophy in the Kāṇva Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Suttanipāta.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"UC Berkeley","source":"escholarship.org","title":"Kosalan Philosophy in the Kāṇva Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Suttanipāta","type":"thesis","URL":"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2940b93h"},

Since then, research has flourished, but a split has developed between those who think that NDEs are evidence for life after death and those who argue that they are just the product of a dying brain.

This collection—among the oldest records of the historical Buddha’s original teachings—consists of 152 suttas or discourses of middle length, distinguished as such from the longer and shorter suttas of the other collections. The Majjhima Nikāya might be concisely described as the Buddhist scripture that combines the richest variety of contextual settings with the deepest and most comprehensive assortment of teachings. These teachings, which range from basic ethics to instructions in meditation and liberating insight, unfold in a fascinating procession of scenarios that show the Buddha in living dialogue with people from many different strata of ancient Indian society: with kings and princes, priests and ascetics, simple villagers and erudite philosophers. Replete with drama, reasoned argument, and illuminating parable and simile, these discourses exhibit the Buddha in the full glory of his resplendent wisdom, majestic sublimity, and compassionate humanity.\n\nThe translation is based on an original draft translation left by the English scholar-monk Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli, which has been edited and revised by the American monk Bhikkhu Bodhi, who provides a long introduction and helpful explanatory notes. Combining lucidity of expression with accuracy, this translation enables the Buddha to speak across twenty-five centuries in language that addresses the most pressing concerns of the contemporary reader seeking clarification of the timeless issues of truth, value, and the proper conduct of life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,15]]},"citation-key":"Bodhi 1995a","collection-title":"Teachings of the Buddha","contributor":[{"family":"Bodhi","given":"Bhikkhu"},{"family":"Ñāṇamoli","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"event-place":"Boston","file":"","ISBN":"978-0-86171-072-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"language":"en","note":"attachment-label:Contents, Preface, Introduction & Summary of Suttas","number-of-pages":"1424","publisher":"Wisdom Publications","publisher-place":"Boston","title":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Majjhima Nikāya","title-short":"The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha","type":"book","URL":"https://wisdomexperience.org/product/middle-length-discourses-buddha/"},

The Anguttara arranges the Buddha s discourses in accordance with a numerical scheme intended to promote retention and easy comprehension. In an age when writing was still in its infancy, this proved to be the most effective way to ensure that the disciples could grasp and replicate the structure of a teaching. A broad survey of the Anguttara Nikaya shows that its primary focus is on practice, and it treats practice from a wide-angle perspective. The subjects of the discourses range from the basic ethical observances recommended to the busy layperson, through the pillars of mind training, to the highest meditative attainments. The Anguttara is also distinguished among the four Nikayas by its interest in types of persons, which it describes and classifies in detail, often with stunning similes.

  {"id":"Bodhi 2017b","abstract":"The latest volume in the Teachings of the Buddha series translates the most ancient layer of the Buddha's teachings, a text that matches the Dhammapada in its concise power and its centrality to the Buddhist tradition. Celebrated translator Bhikkhu Bodhi illuminates these verses and their canonical commentaries with elegant renderings and authoritative annotation in this landmark volume. The Suttanipata, or \"Group of Discourses\" is a collection of sermons by the Buddha that includes some of the most popular suttas of the Pali Canon, such as the Loving-Kindness Sutta and the Rhinoceros-Horn Sutta. The suttas are primarily in verse, though several are in mixed prose and verse. The Suttanipata contains discourses that extol the figure of the muni, the illumined sage, who wanders homeless completely detached from the world. Other suttas, such as the Discourse on Downfall and the Discourse on Blessings, establish the foundations of Buddhist lay ethics. The last two chapters--the Atthakavagga (Chapter of Octads) and the Parayanavagga (The Way to the Beyond)--are considered to be among the most ancient parts of the Pali Canon. The Atthakavagga advocates a critical attitude toward views and doctrines. The Parayanavagga is a beautiful poem in which sixteen spiritual seekers travel across India to meet the Buddha and ask him profound questions pertaining to the highest goal.  The commentary, the Paramatthajotika, relates the background story to each sutta and explains each verse in detail. The volume includes numerous excerpts from the Niddesa, an ancient commentary already included in the Pali Canon, which offers detailed expositions of each verse in the Atthakavagga, the Parayanavagga, and the Rhinoceros Horn Sutta.  The translator provides a long, insightful introduction, a guide to the individual suttas, extensive notes, a list of parallels to the discourses of the Suttanipata, and a list of the numerical sets mentioned in the commentaries.","citation-key":"Bodhi 2017b","contributor":[{"family":"Bodhi","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"file":"","ISBN":"978-1-61429-429-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,26]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"1568","publisher":"Wisdom Publications,U.S.","title":"The Suttanipata: An Ancient Collection of the Buddha’s Discourses Together with Its Commentaries","title-short":"The Suttanipata and Commentaries","type":"book","URL":"https://wisdomexperience.org/product/suttanipata/"},

In this way, students can determine the meaning of each word and phrase and gain an intimate familiarity with the distinctive style of the Pali suttas--with the words, and world, of the earliest Buddhist texts.  Ven. Bodhi's meticulously selected anthology of suttas provides a systematic overview of the Buddha's teachings, mirroring the four noble truths, the most concise formulation of the Buddha's guide to liberation. Reading the Buddha's Discourses in Pali shares with readers not only exceptional language instruction but also a nuanced study of the substance, style, and method of the early Buddhist discourses.","author":[{"family":"Bodhi","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"citation-key":"Bodhi 2021a","event-place":"Somerville, MA, USA","file":"","ISBN":"978-1-61429-700-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,8]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"500","publisher":"Wisdom Publications,U.S.","publisher-place":"Somerville, MA, USA","title":"Reading the Buddha's Discourses in Pali: A Practical Guide to the Language of the Ancient Buddhist Canon","title-short":"Reading the Buddha's Discourses in Pali","type":"book","URL":"https://wisdomexperience.org/product/reading-the-buddhas-discourses-in-pali/"},
  {"id":"Bodhi-Audio 1979a","abstract":"In the fall of 1979, while living at the Washington Buddhist Vihara, Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi gave a series of lectures on the fundamental teachings of Early Buddhism. Bhante Gunaratana, at the time the President of the Buddhist Vihara Society, suggested he record the lectures so that the Vihara could distribute them as a set of cassette tapes.\n\nIn the summer of 1981, Ven. Bodhi recorded his ten lectures in the basement of the Washington Buddhist Vihara, using an ordinary, nonprofessional recorder. An enthusiastic lay supporter had the master copies reproduced in large quantities for expanded distribution. They have continued to be distributed on tape and as CDs for over twenty-five years, and are considered “public domain” for anyone to copy and distribute freely.

  {"id":"Brahmali 2009a","abstract":"The only way of moving towards consensus on the controversial subject of the nature of Nibbana is by appealing to the sole source of authority common to practically all Buddhists: the Nikayas/Agamas. In the present paper I will first give an overview of the usage of the term Nibbana in the Nikayas. I will then argue that, according to the Nikayas, Nibbana cannot be regarded as a self. Next, I will point out that the Nikayas do not see Nibbana as a form of consciousness, including such exceptional kinds of consciousness as anidassana viññana and appatitthita viññana. Nor can Nibbana be regarded as equivalent to mind, or any particular state of mind. In the final section I aim to show that the most reasonable interpretation of the Nikayas is that final Nibbana is no more than the cessation of the five khandhas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Brahmāli","given":"Bhikkhu"}],"call-number":"Original 2009","citation-key":"Brahmali 2009a","container-title":"Buddhist Studies Review","DOI":"10.1558/bsrv.v26i1.33","file":"Brahmāli_2009_What the Nikāyas Say and Do not Say about Nibbāna.pdf","ISSN":"1747-9681","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",8,22]]},"language":"en","note":"attachment-label:Original 2009\ntMS:niknib","page":"33–66","source":"journal.equinoxpub.com","title":"What the Nikāyas Say and Do not Say about Nibbāna","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSR/article/view/8891","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"BronkhorstJ 2007a","abstract":"Greater Magadha, roughly the eastern part of the Gangetic plain of northern India, has so far been looked upon as deeply indebted to Brahmanical culture. Religions such as Buddhism and Jainism are thought of as derived, in one way or another, from Vedic religion. This belief is defective in various respects. The book argues for the importance and independence of Greater Magadha as a cultural area until a date close to the beginning of the Common Era. In order to correct the incorrect notions, two types of questions are dealt with: questions pertaining to cultural and religious dependencies, and questions relating to chronology. As a result a modified picture arises that also has a bearing on the further development of Indian culture. The book is arranged in five parts. Part-I describes cultural features of Greater Magadha, under which there are three chapters-The Fundamental Spiritual Ideology, Other Features and Conclusions. Part-II: Brahmanism vis-a-vis Rebirth and Karmic Retribution has three sections- Hesitantly Accepted, Rebirth and Karmic Retribution Ignored or Rejected, and Urban Brahmins. Under section one there are chapters onó Dharma Sutra, a portion from the Mahabharata and the early Upanisads. Section two features chapters on Rebirth and Karmic Retribution Ignored and Rebirth and Karmic Retribution Rejected. Section three is on urban Brahmins. Part-III dwells on the chronological issues, - linguistic consideration, the Vedic texts known to the early Sanskrit grammarians, to the early Buddhists, some indications in late-Vedic literature, urban versus rural culture, etc. Part-IV is Conclusion, while Part V has useful appendices-The antiquity of the Vedanta philosophy, a Carvaka in the Mahabharata, Vedic texts known to panini, the form of the Rgveda known to Panini, Vedic texts known to Patanjali, Brahmins in the Buddhist canon, Brahmanism in Gandhara and surrounding and Carvakas and the Sabarabhasya.

The Buddha's mystical experience of infinity and totality provides the framework for this objective revelation of the three pervasive and interlocking concepts upon which any study of Mahāyāna philosophy must depend.Following an introductory section describing the essential differences between Judeo-Christian and Buddhist philosophy, Professor Chang provides an extensive, expertly developed section on the philosophical foundations of Hwa Yen Buddhism dealing with the core concept of True Voidness, the philosophy of Totality, and the doctrine of Mind-Only. A concluding section includes selections of Hwa Yen readings and biographies of the patriarchs, as well as a glossary and list of Chinese terms.","author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"Garma C.

Within weeks it became the most hotly debated topic, with Dawkins himself branded as either saint or sinner for presenting his hard-hitting, impassioned rebuttal of religion of all types. His argument could hardly be more topical. While Europe is becoming increasingly secularized, the rise of religious fundamentalism, whether in the Middle East or Middle America, is dramatically and dangerously dividing opinion around the world. In America, and elsewhere, a vigorous dispute between 'intelligent design' and Darwinism is seriously undermining and restricting the teaching of science. In many countries religious dogma from medieval times still serves to abuse basic human rights such as women's and gay rights. And all from a belief in a God whose existence lacks evidence of any kind. Dawkins attacks God in all his forms. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry and abuses children. \"The God Delusion\" is a brilliantly argued, fascinating polemic that will be required reading for anyone interested in this most emotional and important subject.","author":[{"family":"Dawkins","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"DawkinsR 2007a","event-place":"London","file":"","ISBN":"978-0-552-77331-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"464","publisher":"Black Swan","publisher-place":"London","title":"The God Delusion","type":"book"},

Chapter III expounds the production of the thought of Enlightenment for the welfare and liberation of all creatures. Chapters IV describes thirty-seven practices and principles conducive to the attainment of Enlightenment. Chapter V expalins the ten perfections that lead to welfare, rebirth, serenity, spiritual cultivation, and supreme knowledge.

The four volume masterwork begins with a history of Abhidharma literature and covers a vast array of subjects from a Buddhist viewpoint. Some of these subjects are Buddhist cosmology and the process of rebirth, karma and the Buddhist ethical theory, mental defilements, causes of suffering and the path to enlightenment, the supernatural powers of a Buddha, a taxonomy of meditative states and a refutation of the existence of soul.\"... one of the landmark achievements in the history of Buddhist Studies. \nUnder the influence of his teacher, Louis de la Valle Poussin, Prof. Lamotte published several works in French, which were primarily editions, translations and commentaries on Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist texts. The theories and concepts contained in this particular work are closely related to those of the Abhidharmakosa, and as such it makes a valuable companion to that larger work. Here Prof. Pruden has provided a masterful English translation of Prof. Lamotte’s work, and has added a brief biography of Prof. Lamotte and his scholarly accomplishments to familiarize the reader with this great scholar of Buddhism.","citation-key":"deLaValleePoussinL 1988a","contributor":[{"family":"La Vallee Poussin","given":"Louis","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"file":"de La Vallee Poussin-1988-abhidharmakośabhāṣyam-of-vasubhandhu-1.pdf;de La Vallee Poussin-1988-abhidharmakośabhāṣyam-of-vasubhandhu-2.pdf;de La Vallee Poussin-1988-abhidharmakośabhāṣyam-of-vasubhandhu-3.pdf;de La Vallee Poussin-1988-abhidharmakośabhāṣyam-of-vasubhandhu-4.pdf","ISBN":"978-0-89581-908-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"language":"en","note":"attachment-label:Vol 1;2;3;4","number-of-pages":"440","number-of-volumes":"4","publisher":"Asian Humanities Press","title":"Abhidharmakośabhāṣyam of Vasubhandhu","translator":[{"family":"Pruden","given":"Leo M"}],"type":"book","volume":"1–4"},

Both ancient and modern scholars have debated this matter, sometimes with considerable rancour.

In doing so, he also dispels several misconceptions about Buddhism, highlights some rarely discussed problems associated with being vegetarian and details some of the good reasons for becoming one.

Now there are numerous books claiming that the teachings of Jesus and the Buddha are just different versions of the same truth. Is this true or is it the outcome of a superficial examination of the facts or perhaps a genuine but misguided attempt to encourage inter-religious understanding? This book is the first in-depth comparison of the life and teachings of Jesus and the Buddha and presented in the New Testament and the Tipitaka, the Buddhist scriptures. The result is portraits of the two great religious figures very different from how they have traditionally been seen and the question ‘Are Christianity and Buddhism compatible?’ is answered in a way that may surprise many readers.

Because of its teaching of a compassion that includes all sentient life, Buddhism in particular is well placed to make an important contribution to such discussions. The many works resulting from this have tended to focus mainly on human/animal interaction, animal and plant symbolism, and especially environmental ethics. In the present book the author examines the underpinning of all this. The first part examines how north Indian Buddhists tried to explain, define and classify their natural world; everything from its topographical features to metrological phenomena and of course its flora and fauna. The second and largest part lists alphabetically the Pali names of every animal and plant mentioned in early Theravada scriptures, some 580 altogether, describing each, together with its scientific name and uses. The last part lists the medicinal herbs mentioned in the scriptures together with their traditional application and modern usage.

  {"id":"Doniger-Kakar 2003a","abstract":"''When the wheel of sexual ecstasy is in full motion, there is no textbook at all, and no order.''The Kamasutra is the oldest extant Hindu textbook of erotic love. It is about the art of living - about finding a partner, maintaining power in a marriage, committing adultery, living as or with a courtesan, using drugs - and also about the positions in sexual intercourse. It was composed in Sanskrit, the literary language of ancient India, sometime in the third century CE. It combines an encyclopaedic coverage of all imaginable aspects of sex with a closely observed sexual psychology and a dramatic, novelistic narrative of seduction, consummation, and disentanglement. Best known in English through the highly mannered, padded, and inaccurate nineteenth-century translation of Sir Richard Burton, the text is presented here in an entirely new translation into clear, vivid, sexually frank English, together with three commentaries: translated excerpts from the earliest and most famous Sanskrit commentary (13th century) and from a twentieth-century Hindi commentary, and explanatory notes by the two translators. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World''s Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

  {"id":"DrogeTabor 1992a","abstract":"The right to die with dignity has emerged as a crucial issue in the 1990s. As reports of family- or doctor-assisted suicides increase, the issue of voluntary death is occupying an increasingly prominent place in our national consciousness. From theologians, medical ethicists, and talk-show hosts to people facing the issue in their own lives, all are participants in the debate, each seeking to influence and control the discourse on suicide and euthanasia. Now, this pathbreaking study provides a stunning reappraisal of the early history of this controversial human freedom. A Noble Death challenges the often unquestioning attitudes we have toward suicide and traces the evolution of these attitudes from the time of Socrates to the present day. Droge and Tabor reveal the extraordinary fact that early Christians and Jews did not absolutely condemn suicide, but instead focused on whether or not it was committed for noble reasons. In fascinating detail, the texts and traditions presented here--from Greek and Roman philosophy, to Judaism, Christianity, and the Bible itself--make clear that the decision to take one's life, or allow it to be taken, was not considered a sin but a noble choice, provided there was sufficient justification for the act. \"The Bible nowhere proscribes suicide\", the authors write. \"In fact, there are at least seven individuals in the Bible who take their own lives, and none of them is condemned for the act.... Many (have) a vague notion that the so-called Judeo-Christian tradition speaks decisively against the act of suicide, but just what that objection is, when it developed, and what came before it, are mostly not known\". From Socrates' insistence on the requirement ofa divine sign to Seneca's emphasis on the unqualified freedom of the individual to Augustine's attempt to restrict that freedom, A Noble Death illustrates how strongly we share these early attitudes toward voluntary death. But the very attempt to find a consensus indicates how the decision to die could--and can--be a conscientious one. Intensely relevant to the contemporary debate, A Noble Death takes the reader on a challenging and instructive journey to the surprising origins of Western culture's thoughts on voluntary death.","author":[{"family":"Droge","given":"Arthur J."},{"family":"Tabor","given":"James D."}],"citation-key":"DrogeTabor 1992a","file":"","ISBN":"978-0-06-062095-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"language":"en","note":"IACode: nobledeathsuicid00drog","number-of-pages":"234","publisher":"HarperSanFrancisco","title":"A Noble Death: Suicide and Martyrdom Among Christians and Jews in Antiquity","type":"book"},

So how do you wrap your brain around the nature of God’s consciousness and making supper? Have you ever wondered: If karma is really negotiable? About past life karma – why me God? If winning the lottery is karma or dumb luck? If you pick your parents (must rethink choices next life)? If not washing your car has karmic consequences (yes it does!)? If having cancer is related to karma? It is bad karma to question God or is God expecting the question? If the DNA you arrive with is karmic humor? If forgiving someone erases the karma of their actions? About stress and karma – do they always have lunch together? About holidays and karma – is there a gift in this picture? Aren’t these fun questions? Wouldn’t you love to look at karma with a different eye, rather than the painful ‘eye for an eye’ concept? Relax!

  {"id":"Fromm 1956a","abstract":"Since it was first published \" The Art of Loving\" has become a classic, inspiring thousands of people with its clarity and power. Erich Fromm, the renowned psychoanalyst, sees love as the ultimate need and desire of all human beings. In this book, he discusses every aspect of the subject: romantic love, the love of parents for children, brotherly love, erotic love, self-love and the love of God or the divine. He looks at the theory of love as it appears throughout the cultures of the world and at the practice, how we show or fail to show love to one another. Love is an art, which we need to develop and practice in order to find true commitment. We need to find it, individually and as a society as a whole. Erich Fromm is one of the major figures in the field of psychoanalysis. He devoted himself to consultant psychology and theoretical investigation for many years. He was the author of numerous books, including \" Fear of Freedom\" and \"Psychoanalysis and Zen\", before his death in 1980.","author":[{"family":"Fromm","given":"Erich"}],"citation-key":"Fromm 1956a","event-place":"New York City","file":"Fromm-1956-the-art-of-loving.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["1956"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"133","publisher":"Harper & Row","publisher-place":"New York City","title":"The Art of Loving","type":"book"},

  {"id":"GabrielRA 2016a","abstract":"It is one of the more startling facts of military history that the founders of three of the four 'great religions'-Judaism, Buddhism, and Islam-were also accomplished field generals with extensive experience in commanding men in battle. One of these, Muhammad, fought eight battles and was wounded twice, once almost fatally. Another, Siddhartha Gautama (later to become the Buddha), witnessed so much battlefield carnage that he suffered a psychological collapse. Moses had become so much a 'god-intoxicated' personality, it is a reasonable suspicion that he, like the Buddha, was murdered. Indeed, had the experiences of these men in war not been so successful, it is quite possible that their achievements as religious leaders would never have occurred. For all three, war and religion were so closely intertwined in their personalities that it is difficult to discern where the influence of one ended and the other began. This book attempts to explore the military lives of Moses, the Buddha and Muhammad, and the role their war experiences played in their religious lives.","author":[{"family":"Gabriel","given":"Professor Richard A."}],"citation-key":"GabrielRA 2016a","event-place":"Havertown","file":"","ISBN":"978-1-4738-5904-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"240","publisher":"Pen & Sword Books Ltd","publisher-place":"Havertown","title":"God's Generals: The Military Lives of Moses, the Buddha and Muhammad","type":"book"},

C. Wijesinha's Mahavamsa published in 1889, and were in correspondence on the subject with the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. The Society appointed a numerous and influential Committee, and recommended myself as Editor for Europe. By their letter of July 18, 1908, the Government of Ceylon requested me to undertake that post. I took the opportunity at the Congress of Orientalists held at Copenhagen in August, and again at the Congress on the History of Religions held in September at Oxford, to consult my colleagues on the best plan for carrying out the proposed revision. They agreed that the method most likely to lead to a satisfactory result within a reasonable time was to entrust the work to one competent critical scholar who could, if necessary, consult members of the Ceylon Committee, but who should be himself responsible for all the details of the work. I reported to Government accordingly, and recommended that Prof. Geiger, who had just completed his edition of the text, should be asked to undertake the task. The Government approved the plan, and asked me to make the necessary arrangements. Those arrangements have resulted in the publication of the present volume.About the PublisherForgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

It is intended to be a textbook for students of religious and Asian studies respectively, but will also be of interest to those who want a general survey of Buddhism and its beliefs. Unlike many other general books about Buddhism, it not only explores Buddhist beliefs, but also seeks to show as a set of practices. It thus includes chapters on devotion, ethics, monastic practices and meditation. Such practices are related to Buddhist teachings and historical developments. Emphasising as it does the diversity found within different Buddhist traditions, the book aims to underline common threads of belief, practice and historical continuities which unify the Buddhist world.

  {"id":"JacksonP 2003a","abstract":"Buddhadasa Bhikkhu (1906–1993) is widely regarded as modern Thailand’s most influential Buddhist philosopher. His thought had a profound intellectual impact in Thailand in the second half of the twentieth century. His life mission was to undertake a complete reexamination of Theravada Buddhist teachings. By returning to the Buddha’s original teachings in the Suttapitaka and by drawing on aspects of Zen Buddhism, Buddhadasa crafted a vision of Thai Buddhism as a socially, politically, and intellectually progressive force. This vision of a modern Theravada Buddhism fit for a modern, democratic, and socially just Thailand continues to inspire large numbers of Thai people in the twenty-first century.In this book Peter Jackson examines Buddhadasa’s life work and thought, placing them in the context of the political, economic, and intellectual changes that transformed Thailand in the twentieth century. Combining biographical studies with critical philosophical and sociological analyses of Buddhadasa’s reforms of Thai Buddhist teachings, Peter Jackson emphasizes the path-breaking and often radical ideas of one of the greatest Buddhist thinkers of the last century. This book is a revised and expanded edition of Peter Jackson’s Buddhadasa: A Buddhist Thinker for the Modern World, published in 1988. It contains a new epilogue tracing the controversy surrounding Buddhadasa’s death in 1993 and reflecting on the philosopher-monk’s lasting legacy in Thailand.","author":[{"family":"Jackson","given":"Peter A."}],"citation-key":"JacksonP 2003a","event-place":"Chiang Mai","file":"","ISBN":"978-974-7551-91-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"English","note":"IACode: buddhadasatherav0000jack","number-of-pages":"392","publisher":"Silkworm Books","publisher-place":"Chiang Mai","title":"Buddhadasa: Theravada Buddhism and Modernist Reform in Thailand","type":"book"},

His discussions of conversion, repentance, mysticism and saintliness, and his observations on actual, personal religious experiences - all support this thesis. In his introduction, Martin E.

  {"id":"JonesDhivan 2022a","abstract":"This article investigates the original meaning of dependent arising in the Buddha’s teaching, by focussing on the imasmiṃ sati formula. Modern scholars such as the Rhys Davidses, K.N. Jayatilleke and Paul Williams have interpreted it as a principle of causation, comparable to a scientific conception of causation. I argue instead that this formula implies that the Buddha held that causation is nothing more than the correlation of causes and effects, and that it commits the Buddha to a Humean regularity thesis about causation. I draw a distinction between the Buddhist and scientific concepts of causation, and then summarise an alternative approach made by more recent scholars such as Sue Hamilton, Noa Ronkin and Eviatar Shulman, who present dependent arising in terms of conditionality in the causal structure of subjective experience. I conclude by presenting the argument that the imasmiṃ sati formula does not express a principle of causation but is rather a formula for the method of discovering and presenting causation as conditionality in experience.","author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Dhivan Thomas"}],"citation-key":"JonesDhivan 2022a","container-title":"Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies","file":"Jones_2022_“This Being, That Becomes”.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"119–155","title":"“This Being, That Becomes”: Reconsidering the Role of The Imasmiṃ Sati Formula in Early Buddhism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?url=article&id=3291578&journal_code=JIABS","volume":"45"},

Urban spheres, Irom this perspective, often look as dull as the dust from which they emerge.  But the early Indian city wasn't like that at all, says Shonaleeka Kaul: it was certainly not only brickand-mortar, nor merely an agglomeration of built up space. In Sanskrit literature these cities were alive, vibrant, teeming with variety, Kaul examines Samkrit kavyas over about a thousand years to see what India's early historic cities were like as living, lived-in, entities. She looks at ideologies, altitudes, institutions, and practices in ancient urban areas, showing the ways in which they often cohered into a world view, a mentalite.  'Ihis is also a book about Sanskrit literature. Scholars have long argued for a nuanccd use of literary texts to achieve a more rounded understanding of ancient history, and Kaul achieves exactly that. She takes forward the idea of a Sanskrit 'literary culture', arguing that genres influence methods of historical representation. Her book gives us a fresh view of the early city, showing distinctive urban ways of thought and behaviour which relate in complex w.iys to tradition, morality, and authority. In advocating Sanskrit kavyas an important historical source, it addresses not just ancient India specialists bur also scholars of literary history: the kavyas rework history, says Kaul, providing us with 'transhistoricity' rather than 'ahistoricity.

Written by a teacher, psychologist, and meditation master of international renown, this warm, inspiring, and expert book touches on a wide range of essential issues including many rarely addressed in spiritual books. From compassion, addiction, and psychological and emotional healing, to dealing with problems involving relationships and sexuality, to the creation of a Zen-like simplicity and balance in all facets of life, it speaks to the concerns of many modern spiritual seekers, both those beginning on the path and those with years of experience.\n \nA Path with Heart is filled with practical techniques, guided meditations, stories, koans, and other gems of wisdom that can help ease your journey through the world. The author’s own profound—and sometimes humorous—experiences and gentle assistance will skillfully guide you through the obstacles and trials of spiritual and contemporary life to bring a clarity of perception and a sense of the sacred into your everyday experience. Reading this book will touch your heart and remind you of the promises inherent in meditation and in a life of the spirit: the blossoming of inner peace, wholeness, and understanding, and the achievement of a happiness that is not dependent on external conditions.\n \nSure to be a classic, A Path with Heart shows us how we can bring our spirituality to flower every day of our lives.

  {"id":"LevmanBG 2013a","abstract":"While the linguistic influence of India’s indigenous languages on the Indo- Aryan language (IA) is well understood, the cultural impact of the autochthonous Munda, Dravidian and Tibeto-Burman speaking peoples is much harder to evaluate, due to the lack of indigenous coeval records, and later historicization of the Buddha’s life and teachings. Nevertheless, there are cultural remnants of the indigenous belief systems discoverable in the Buddhist scriptures. In this article we examine 1) The longstanding hostility between the IA immigrants and the eastern ethnic groups, especially the Buddha’s Sakya clan. 2) The Sakyas’ socio-political organization, religious and cultural values which differ significantly from those of the immigrants. 3) The concept of the Mah?puru?a which was likely an historicization of an indigenous Indian belief. 4) Indigenous belief structures like serpent- and tree-worship and the culture of sacred groves, and 5) Indigenous funeral rites in the story of the Buddha’s parinibb?na.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Levman","given":"Bryan Geoffrey"}],"citation-key":"LevmanBG 2013a","container-title":"Buddhist Studies Review","container-title-short":"BSRV","DOI":"10.1558/bsrv.v30i2.145","file":"Levman-2014-cultural-remnants-of-the-indigenous-peoples.pdf","ISSN":"1747-9681, 0265-2897","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cultural Remnants of the Indigenous Peoples in the Buddhist Scriptures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journal.equinoxpub.com/BSR/article/view/13702","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"LevmanBG 2020a","abstract":"What language did the Buddha speak? Scholars think it was Pāli, or something very close to it. This book argues that the medium in which the Buddha spoke is just as important as the message. It answers the question, “how does the sonic content of Pāli carry the Buddha’s message, complement and enhance it?”Pāli is based on an oral, vernacular language of the people, full of natural idioms and colloquial expressions. It is the opposite of Sanskrit, the formal, abstract, liturgical language of Brahmanism. In its conversational directness, harmony and musicality, oral immediacy and visceral emotivity, Pāli speaks to the here and now, to the urgency of man’s suffering and to the practicality of a philosophy which promises to end it.Anyone interested in Theravādin Buddhism, what the Buddha taught and the special nature of the language in which he taught will find this book engaging. Buddhist practitioners will find it especially beneficial for their meditation and recitation practice. Academics in any area of Buddhism and Historical Linguistics who do not know Pāli will find it a useful introduction to the language and its evolution, while Pāli scholars will find here a unique perspective on the special role the language played in the communication of the Buddha’s teachings.","author":[{"family":"Levman","given":"Bryan Geoffrey"}],"citation-key":"LevmanBG 2020a","file":"","ISBN":"978-1-5275-4700-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"311","publisher":"Cambridge Scholars Publishing","title":"Pāli, the Language: The Medium and Message","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridgescholars.com/product/978-1-5275-4195-5"},
  {"id":"LevmanBG 2021a","abstract":"This book is a collection of essays on the history and evolution of the Pāli language, which preserves the earliest record of the Buddha’s teaching. Although only the Pāli record has survived, it argues that the Buddha also taught in several of the indigenous languages of northern India, including Dravidian, probably Munda and possibly others. Pāli was derived from a koiné or common language for inter-dialect communication between the different dialects spoken by the Indo-Aryan immigrants, but was also strongly influenced by the languages of the indigenous peoples, Dravidian and Munda. The language of the Buddha’s native clan, the Sakyas, was probably Dravidian, which had a Munda substrate. The Buddha was bi- or multilingual and taught in the Indo Aryan koiné of the immigrants, but also in the local language(s) of his people, whose impact may be found in extensive word and cultural borrowing from these languages into Indo-Aryan, and a significant phonological, morphological and syntactical imprint on Pāli and other Indo-Aryan languages. The book examines this influence and other factors of language change over time in the context of current theories of comparative philology.","author":[{"family":"Levman","given":"Bryan Geoffrey"}],"citation-key":"LevmanBG 2021a","event-place":"Newcastle-upon-Tyne","file":"","ISBN":"978-1-5275-7555-4 978-1-5275-7687-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"490","publisher":"Cambridge Scholars Publisher","publisher-place":"Newcastle-upon-Tyne","title":"Pāli and Buddhism: Language and Lineage","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridgescholars.com/product/978-1-5275-7555-4"},

  {"id":"Lopez 1997a","abstract":"It is well known from the work of Wilhelm Rau that the opposition of eater (attṛ) and eaten (adya) is used by the Vedic poets as a conceptual frame to articulate social ideology. 2 As Ś.B 13.2.9.8 and numerous other passages put it: the brahmins and the kṣatriya-s unite to ‘eat’ the people (viś). Life and society are understood by the Vedic poets in terms of the basic struggle of acquiring food. Food itself becomes the most basic conceptual tool by which the functioning of the human being, human society and the cosmos are understood. Food as a conceptual tool may be seen in its most basic form in the statement of Taittirīya Upaniṣad (TU) 3.10, which identifies food (annam) as prathamajā ṛtasya “the first born of ṛta.” That annam is conceived as more than just everyday, edible goods is clear from the fact that food is personified as the first born progeny of the most important abstract power in the Veda, namely, ñta, “the active power of truth,” which underlies all cosmic, divine and human action. In this passage, food is placed at the center of the eschatological vision of Vedic culture. Immortality, an unending existence in the next world, is articulated in terms of food. This paper begins to explore the role of food, as a general category, in the expression of concepts and ideas that form part of the eschatological vision of Vedic religion. The focus of this paper will be to show that key eschatological concepts - the notion of immortality (amṛta),3 the vision of heaven, and its opposite (nirṛti ) - are construed within a ‘nutritionally fixated’ worldview; a worldview that at every turn construes ideas, concepts, and processes (both cosmic and human) from the point of view nutritional necessity. This does not mean, of course, that this is the only worldview present in the Vedic texts; rather this gastronomic worldview is one that can be pieced together from various hints and suggestions that are scattered throughout the corpus of Vedic literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Lopez","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"Lopez 1997a","container-title":"Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies","DOI":"10.11588/EJVS.1997.3.824","file":"Lopez_1997_Food and Immortality in the Veda.pdf","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"language":"en","page":"11-19 Seiten","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Food and Immortality in the Veda: A Gastronomic Theology?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hasp.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/ejvs/article/view/824","volume":"3"},

The various teachings of the Buddha, found throughout the Pali Canon, are organized in a clear, comprehensive manner. In the course of his treatise Buddhaghosa gives full and detailed instructions on the forty subjects of meditation aimed at concentration, an elaborate account of the Buddhist Abhidhamma philosophy, and explicit descriptions of the stages of insight culminating in final liberation.The author, Bhadantacaryia Buddhaghosa, composed the Visuddhimagga in the early part of the 5th century A.D. The India-born monk-scholar traveled to Sri Lanka to translate into Pali the extensive Sinhalese commentaries preserved there.

One who earnestly takes up the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path for the attainment of this goal, might sometimes be dismayed to find this medley of views confronting him. Right View, as the first factor of that path, has always to be in the vanguard in one’s practice. In the interests of this Right View, which one has to progressively ‘straighten-up’, a need for clarification before purification might sometimes be strongly felt.

  {"id":"OFlahertyWD 1980a","abstract":"Karma is perhaps the most famous concept in Indian philosophy, but this is the first comprehensive study of its various meanings and philosophical implications. Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions offers a harmony of approach and an underlying set of methodological assumptions: a corpus of definitions of karma, a dialectic between abstract theory and historical explanation, and an awareness of logical oppositions in theories of karma. No “solution” to the paradox of karma is offered, but the volume as a whole presents a consistent and encompassing approach to the many different, often conflicting, Indian statements of the problem.   Broad in scope and richly detailed, this book demonstrates the impossibility of speaking of “the theory of karma” and supplies the basis for further study. Exploring methodological issues arising in the study of a non-Western system of soteriology and rebirth, the contributors question the interaction of medical and philosophical models of the human body, the incorporation of philosophical theories into practical religions with which they are logically incompatible, and the problem of historical reconstruction of a complex theory of human life.   This title is part of UC Press’s Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press’s mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

  {"id":"Ohnuma 2008a","abstract":"This is the first comprehensive study of a central narrative theme in premodern South Asian Buddhist literature: the Buddha's bodily self- sacrifice during his previous lives as a bodhisattva. Conducting close readings of stories from Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, and Tibetan literature written between the third century B.c.e. and the late medieval period, Reiko Ohnuma argues that this theme has had a major impact on the development of Buddhist philosophy and culture. Whether he takes the form of king, prince, ascetic, elephant, hare, serpent, or god, the bodhisattva repeatedly gives his body or parts of his flesh to others. He leaps into fires, drowns himself in the ocean, rips out his tusks, gouges out his eyes, and lets mosquitoes drink from his blood, always out of selflessness and compassion and to achieve this highest state of Buddhahood. Ohnuma places these stories into a discrete subgenre of South Asian Buddhist literature and approaches them like case studies, analyzing their plots, characterizations, and rhetoric. She then relates the theme of the Buddha's bodily self-sacrifice to major conceptual discourses in the history of Buddhism and South Asian religions, such as the categories of the gift, the body (both ordinary and extraordinary) , kingship, sacrifice, ritual offering, and death. The work reveals a very sophisticated and influential perception of the body in South Asian Buddhist literature and highlights the way in which these stories have provided an important cultural resource for Buddhists. Combined with her rich and careful translations of classic texts, Ohnuma introduces a whole new understanding of a vital concept in Buddhists studies.","author":[{"family":"Ohnuma","given":"Reiko"}],"citation-key":"Ohnuma 2008a","event-place":"Delhi","file":"","ISBN":"978-81-208-3360-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"372","publisher":"Motilal Banarsidass","publisher-place":"Delhi","title":"Bodily Self Sacrifice in Indian Buddhist Literature","type":"book","URL":"https://www.motilalbanarsidass.com/products/bodily-self-sacrifice-in-indian-buddhist-literature"},

  {"id":"Olalde 2015a","abstract":"Nāmarūpa (literally “name and form”) is widely known as a Buddhist concept, relevant in the context of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda), and the skandhas. Yet, the compound is also found in the early Upaniṣads and a closer look at the Vedic corpus reveals that nāman and rūpa also appear closely related to each other in earlier texts. Generally, textual scholars explain nāmarūpa—both in Buddhist and non-Buddhist texts—as a designation of “individuality” or “empirical reality,” whereby nāman and rūpa tend to be regarded as counterparts. In this paper I consider the “non-Buddhist” use of the term from a linguistic perspective. Inspired on a 1987 article by Edward S. Small, I intend to explore to what extent modern theories on the linguistic sign—such as Saussure’s bipartite model of signifier and signified, and the triangle of reference of Ogden and Richards (1923)—may shed light on the relationship between nāman and rūpa and help us establish finer nuances in the meaning of the compound. The purpose of this analysis is to challenge tacit assumptions about language in recent interpretations of nāmarūpa and thus contribute to a better understanding of its usage in Buddhist texts prior to the systematization of the Abhidharma.","author":[{"family":"Olalde","given":"Liudmila"}],"citation-key":"Olalde 2015a","DOI":"10.11588/HEIDOK.00023687","event-place":"Bangkok","event-title":"16th World Sanskrit Conference","file":"Olalde_2015_Nāmarūpa; a Linguistic Perspective.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"license":"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives Germany","publisher":"Heidelberg University Library","publisher-place":"Bangkok","title":"Nāmarūpa; a Linguistic Perspective","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.11588/heidok.00023687"},

Part II\nGobhila, \nHiranyakesin, \nÂpastamba\nThere are, as it seems, no direct traces Of the' Grzhya ceremonies in the most ancient portion of Vedic litera ture. It is certain indeed that a number of the most important of those ceremonies are contemporaneous with or even earlier than the most ancient hymns of the Rig Veda, as far as their fundamental elements and character are concerned, whatever their precise arrangement may have been. However, in the literature of the oldest period they play no part. It was another portion of the ritual that attracted the attention of the poets to whom we owe the hymns to Agni, Indra, and the other deities of the Vedic Olympus, Viz. The Offerings Of the srauta-ritual with their far superior pomp, or, to state the matter more precisely, among the offerings of the srauta-ritual the Soma offer ing. In the Soma Offering centred the thought, the poetry, and we may almost say the life of the Vasisht/zas, of the Visvamitras, &c., in whose families the poetry Of the Rig-veda had its home. We may assume that the acts of the Grz'hya worship, being more limited in extent and Simpler in their ritual construction than the great Soma Offerings, were not yet at that time, so far as they existed at all, decked out with the reciting of the poetic texts, which we find later on connected with them, and which in the case of the Soma Offering came early to be used. Probably they were celebrated in simple unadorned fashion.About the PublisherForgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

  {"id":"OlivelleP 1999a","abstract":"The Dharmasutras are the four surviving works of the ancient Indian expert tradition on the subject of dharma, or the rules of behaviour a community recognizes as binding on its members.  Written in a pithy and aphoristic style and representing the culmination of a long tradition of scholarship, the Dharmasutras record intense disputes and divergent views on such subjects as the education of the young and their rites of passage, ritual procedures and religious ceremonies, marriage and marital rights and obligations, dietary restrictions, the right professions for and the proper interaction between different social groups, sins and their expiations, institutions for the pursuit of holiness, king and the administration of justice, crimes and punishments, death and ancestral rites. In short, these unique documents give us a glimpse of how people, especially Brahmin males, were ideally expected to live their lives within an ordered and hierarchically arranged society.  In this first English translation of the Dharmasutras for over a century, Patrick Olivelle uses the same lucid and elegant style as in his award-winning translation of the Upanisads and incorporates the most recent scholarship on ancient Indian law, society, and religion. Complex material is helpfully organized, making this the ideal edition for the non-specialist as well as for students of Indian society and religion.","citation-key":"OlivelleP 1999a","contributor":[{"family":"Olivelle","given":"Patrick"}],"file":"Olivelle-1999-the-dharmasūtras-the-law-codes-of-ancient-india.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"386","publisher":"OUP Oxford","title":"The Dharmasūtras: The Law Codes of Ancient India","title-short":"The Dharmasūtras","type":"book"},

  {"id":"OlivelleP 2008a","abstract":"“Life of the Buddha” (Buddhacarita) was composed by a Buddhist monk named Ashva·ghosha in the first or second century CE probably in the north-central Indian city of Ayódhya. This text is the earliest surviving example of the Sanskrit literary genre called kāvya (ornate epic poetry) and probably provided models for Kali·dasa’s more famous poetical works. The fourteen Cantos extant in Sanskrit take the reader from the birth of Siddhártha, the future Buddha, to his Awakening when he discovered the truths of the Buddhist doctrine. Some of the most poignant scenes of the text take place when the young prince is, on the one hand, confronted by the reality of human life subject to sickness, old age, and death, and, on the other, seduced by the charms of the women employed by his father to keep him at home.\n\nAlthough it is a poetic composition of the highest order, Ashva·ghosha’s main aim is not to entertain but to instruct, to present the Buddha’s teaching as the culmination of the Brahmanical tradition. His wonderful descriptions of the lovely bodies of the courtesans are ultimately meant to show the transience of beauty:\n\nOthers, grasping branches\nof mango in full bloom,\nbent down to expose breasts\nresembling golden pots. (4.35)\n\nIn sleep these same lovely girls reveal their true nature, which prompts Siddhártha to leave home and become an ascetic:\n\nAnother was lying as if she was drunk,\nmouth wide open and saliva oozing,\nlegs wide open and genitals exposed,\nbody distorted, looking repulsive.

  {"id":"OlivelleP 2013a","abstract":"King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India presents an English translation of Kautilya's Arthashastra (AS.) along with detailed endnotes. When it was discovered in 1923, the Arthashastra was described as perhaps the most precious work in the whole range of Sanskrit literature, an assessment that still rings true. This new translation of this significant text, the first in close to half a century takes into account a number of important advances in our knowledge of the texts, inscriptions, and archeological and art historical remains from the period in Indian history to which the AS. belongs (2nd-3rd century CE, although parts of it may be much older). The text is what we would today call a scientific treatise. It codifies a body of knowledge handed down in expert traditions. It is specifically interested in two things: first, how a king can expand his territory, keep enemies at bay, enhance his external power, and amass riches; second, how a king can best organize his state bureaucracy to consolidate his internal power, to suppress internal enemies, to expand the economy, to enhance his treasury through taxes, duties, and entrepreneurial activities, to keep law and order, and to settle disputes among his subjects. The book is accordingly divided into two sections: the first encompassing Books 1-5 deals with internal matters, and the second spanning Books 6-14 deals with external relations and warfare. The AS. stands alone: there is nothing like it before it and there is nothing after it-if there were other textual productions within that genre they are now irretrievably lost. Even though we know of many authors who preceded Kautilya, none of their works have survived the success of the AS. Being \"textually\" unique makes it difficult to understand and interpret difficult passages and terms; we cannot look to parallels for help. The AS. is also unique in that, first, it covers such a vast variety of topics and, second, it presents in textual form expert traditions in numerous areas of human and social endeavors that were handed down orally. Expert knowledge in diverse fields communicated orally from teacher to pupil, from father to son, is here for the first time codified in text. These fields include: building practices of houses, forts, and cities; gems and gemology; metals and metallurgy; mining, forestry and forest management; agriculture; manufacture of liquor; animal husbandry, shipping, and the management of horses and elephants- and so on. Finally, it is also unique in presenting a viewpoint distinctly different from the Brahmanical \"party line\" we see in most ancient Indian documents.","author":[{"family":"Olivelle","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"OlivelleP 2013a","edition":"Illustrated edition","event-place":"New York","file":"","ISBN":"978-0-19-989182-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"English","note":"IACode: kinggovernancela0000kaua","number-of-pages":"784","publisher":"OUP USA","publisher-place":"New York","title":"King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India: Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra","title-short":"King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Palden 1997a","abstract":"“With this memoir by a ‘simple monk’ who spent 33 years in prisons and labor camps for resisting the Chinese, a rare Tibetan voice is heard.” —The New York Times Book Review   Palden Gyatso was born in a Tibetan village in 1933 and became an ordained Buddhist monk at eighteen—just as Tibet was in the midst of political upheaval. When Communist China invaded Tibet in 1950, it embarked on a program of “reform” that would eventually affect all of Tibet’s citizens and nearly decimate its ancient culture. In 1967, the Chinese destroyed monasteries across Tibet and forced thousands of monks into labor camps and prisons. Gyatso spent the next twenty-five years of his life enduring interrogation and torture simply for the strength of his beliefs. Palden Gyatso’s story bears witness to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the strength of Tibet’s proud civilization, faced with cultural genocide.   “To readers of this memoir, however untraveled, Tibet will never again seem remote or unfamiliar. . . . Gyatso reminds us that the language of suffering is universal.” —Library Journal   “Has the ring of undeniable truth. . . .

  {"id":"Ram 2013a","abstract":"Language: Sanskrit Text with Transliteration and English TranslationPages: 1260Volume I About the Book Atharvaveda gives us the idea of Modernity as theessence of the dynamics of life and existence. The Ultimate Reality is Sanatan-eternal, universal, original and ever vital,constant in the essence and mutable in existence, every moment. The Sanatan renews itself, every moment, the same yet not thesame all time, just as the day-night cycle, bright and dark, is the same as beforeand after, and yet it is new every morning in relation to time. Modernity isthus the latest manifestation of existence is relation to the past and obsoletein relation to the future (10.8.23) but poised ever in the present. And this istrue in and of all fields of life including Dharma and values. Atharvaveda, as all the other three, asserts theUnity of God (13, 4. 16- 18): God is One, not two, northree, nor four, nor five, nor six, nor seven, nor eight, nor nine, nor ten.All the manifestation of the One are called bydifferent names. Atharvaveda begins with a prayer for the zest oflife and celebrates the honey sweets of life : Let the winds blow honey sweet,let the rivers flow honey sweet, let the oceans roll honey sweet and so on andon. Atharvaveda celebrates the Earth as one Mother homeof humanity and enjoins all to come and be family.

  {"id":"SchaffP 1885a","abstract":"The Ante-Nicene Fathers, subtitled \"The Writings of the Fathers Down to A.D. 325\", is a collection of books in 10 volumes (one volume is indexes) containing English translations of the majority of Early Christian writings. The period covers the beginning of Christianity until before the promulgation of the Nicene Creed at the First Council of Nicaea. The translations are very faithful, but sometimes rather old-fashioned.The series was originally published between 1867 and 1873 by the Presbyterian publishing house T. & T. Clark in Edinburgh under the title Ante-Nicene Christian Library, as a response to the Oxford movement's Library of the Fathers which was perceived as too Roman Catholic. The volumes were edited by Rev. Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson. This series was available by subscription but the editors were unable to interest enough subscribers to commission a translation of the homilies of Origen. In 1885 a US firm, the Christian Literature Company, first of Buffalo, then New York, began to issue the volumes in a reorganised form, edited by the Episcopalian bishop of New York, A. Cleveland Coxe. Coxe gave his \"new\" series the title: The Ante-Nicene Fathers. In 1896, the American edition/revision was complete. In 1897, the volume 9 of this one which contained new translations, was published by T. & T. Clark as an additional volume to complete the original ANCL.This is Volume III: Latin Christianity: Its Founder, Tertullian, and it focuses on the work of Tertullian, who is often called the \"father of Latin Christianity.\" It brings together three of his most important works. These writings were heavily influential on the early Church, and for good reason, as they are inspirational and encouraging. These volumes also come with many useful notes.","author":[{"family":"Schaff","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"SchaffP 1885a","collection-number":"3 of 10","collection-title":"Ante-Nicene Fathers","editor":[{"family":"Menzies","given":"Allan"}],"event-place":"MI","file":"Schaff-1885-latin-christianity-its-founder-tertullian.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["1885"]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Grand Rapids","publisher-place":"MI","title":"Latin Christianity: Its Founder, Tertullian","type":"book","URL":"https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.html"},

  {"id":"Shulman 2007a","abstract":"Dependent-origination, possibly the most fundamental Buddhist philosophical principle, is generally understood as a description of all that exists. Mental as well as physical phenomena are believed to come into being only in relation to, and conditioned by, other phenomena. This paper argues that such an understanding of pratītya-samutpāda is mistaken with regard to the earlier meanings of the concept. Rather than relating to all that exists, dependent-origination related originally only to processes of mental conditioning. It was an analysis of the self, not of reality, embedded in the Upaniṣadic search for the ātman. The teaching also possessed important ontological implications regarding the nature of the relation between consciousness and reality. These implications suggest that rather than things being conditioned by other things, they are actually conditioned by consciousness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Shulman","given":"Eviatar"}],"citation-key":"Shulman 2007a","container-title":"Journal of Indian Philosophy","container-title-short":"J Indian Philos","DOI":"10.1007/s10781-007-9030-8","file":"Shulman_2008_Early Meanings of Dependent-Origination.pdf","ISSN":"0022-1791, 1573-0395","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",4]]},"language":"en","page":"297–317","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Early Meanings of Dependent-Origination","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10781-007-9030-8","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"SiegelL 1991a","abstract":"Vast like the subcontinent itself and teeming with outrageous and exotic characters, Net of Magic is an enthralling voyage through the netherworld of Indian magic. Lee Siegel, scholar and magician, uncovers the age-old practices of magic in sacred rites and rituals and unveils the contemporary world of Indian magic of street and stage entertainers.  Siegel's journeys take him from ancient Sanskrit texts to the slums of New Delhi to find remnants of a remarkable magical tradition. In the squalid settlement of Shadipur, he is initiated into a band of Muslim street conjurers and performs as their shill while they tutor him in their con and craft. Siegel also becomes acquainted with Hindu theatrical magicians, who claim descent from court illusionists and now dress as maharajahs to perform a repertoire of tricks full of poignant kitsch and glitz.  Masterfully using a panoply of narrative sleights to recreate the magical world of India, Net of Magic intersperses travelogue, history, ethnography, and fiction. Siegel's vivid, often comic tale is crowded with shills and stooges, tourists and pickpockets, snake charmers and fakirs. Among the cast of characters are Naseeb, a poor Muslim street magician who guides Siegel into the closed circle of itinerant performers; the Industrial Magician, paid by a bank, who convinces his audience to buy traveler's checks by making twenty-rupee notes disappear; the Government Magician, who does a trick with condoms to encourage family planning; P. C. Sorcar, Jr., the most celebrated Indian stage magician; and the fictive Professor M. T. Bannerji, the world's greatest magician, who assumes various guises over a millennium of Indian history and finally arrives in the conjuring capital of the world—Las Vegas.  Like Indra's net—the web of illusion in which Indian performers ensnare their audience—Net of Magic captures the reader in a seductive portrayal of a world where deception is celebrated and lies are transformed into compelling and universal truths.","author":[{"family":"Siegel","given":"Lee"}],"citation-key":"SiegelL 1991a","event-place":"New Delhi","file":"","ISBN":"978-0-226-75687-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"464","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"New Delhi","title":"Net of Magic: Wonders and Deceptions in India","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Singer 2009a","abstract":"In the first volume, Singer begins by studying love as appraisal and bestowal as well as imagination and idealization. He then examines the contrasting views of Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Ovid, Lucretius, Saint Augustine, Saint Thomas Aquinas, and Martin Luther. After having described the nature of erotic idealization, Singer analyzes the religious idealization in Judeo-Christian concepts of eros, philia, nomos, and agape. Medieval Catholicism sought to combine these four ideas of love in the “caritas synthesis.” Luther repudiated that attempt on the grounds that love exists only in God’s agapastic bestowal of unlimited goodness upon humanity and all of nature.

  {"id":"Singer 2009b","abstract":"In the second volume, Singer studies the ideas and ideals of medieval courtly love and nineteenth-century Romantic love, as well as the transition between these two perspectives. According to the traditions of courtly love in the twelfth century and thereafter, not only God but also human beings in themselves are capable of authentic love. The pursuit of love between man and woman was seen as a splendid ideal that ennobles both the lover and the beloved. It was something more than libidinal sexuality and involved sophisticated and highly refined courtliness that emulated religious love in its ability to create a holy union between the participants. Adherents to Romantic love in later centuries, affirmed the capacity of love to effect a merging between two people who thus became one. Singer analyzes the transition from courtly to Romantic by reference to the writings of many artists beginning with Dante and ending with Richard Wagner, as well as Neoplatonist philosophers of the Italian Renaissance, Descartes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Hume, Kant, Hegel, and Schopenhauer. In relation to romanticism itself, he distinguishes between two aspects—”benign romanticism” and “Romantic pessimism”—that took on renewed importance in the twentieth century.","author":[{"family":"Singer","given":"Irving"}],"citation-key":"Singer 2009b","collection-title":"The Nature of Love","event-place":"Cambridge, Mass","file":"","ISBN":"978-0-262-51273-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"note":"IACode: natureoflove0002sing_d9a0","number-of-pages":"513","number-of-volumes":"3","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Mass","title":"The Nature of Love, II: Courtly and Romantic","title-short":"The Nature of Love, Volume 2","type":"book","URL":"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/655008/the-nature-of-love-volume-2-by-irving-singer/","volume":"2"},

He begins by discussing “anti-Romantic Romantics” (focusing on Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Tolstoy), influential nineteenth-century thinkers whose views illustrate much of the ambiguity and self-contradiction that permeate thinking about love in the last hundred years. He offers detailed studies of Freud, Proust, Shaw, D. H. Lawrence, and Santayana, and he maps the ideas about love in Continental existentialism, particularly those of Sartre and de Beauvoir. Singer finally envisages a future of cooperation between pluralistic humanists and empirical scientists.

  {"id":"SinghU 2017a","abstract":"Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru helped create the myth of a nonviolent ancient India while building a modern independence movement on the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa). But this myth obscures a troubled and complex heritage: a long struggle to reconcile the ethics of nonviolence with the need to use violence to rule. Upinder Singh documents the dynamic tension between violence and nonviolence in ancient Indian political thought and practice over twelve hundred years.Political Violence in Ancient India looks at representations of kingship and political violence in epics, religious texts, political treatises, plays, poems, inscriptions, and art from 600 BCE to 600 CE. As kings controlled their realms, fought battles, and meted out justice, intellectuals debated the boundary between the force required to sustain power and the excess that led to tyranny and oppression. Duty (dharma) and renunciation were important in this discussion, as were punishment, war, forest tribes, and the royal hunt. Singh reveals a range of perspectives that defy rigid religious categorization. Buddhists, Jainas, and even the pacifist Maurya emperor Ashoka recognized that absolute nonviolence was impossible for kings.By 600 CE religious thinkers, political theorists, and poets had justified and aestheticized political violence to a great extent. Nevertheless, questions, doubt, and dissent remained. These debates are as important for understanding political ideas in the ancient world as for thinking about the problem of political violence in our own time.","author":[{"family":"Singh","given":"Upinder"}],"citation-key":"SinghU 2017a","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","file":"Singh-2017-political-violence-in-ancient-india.pdf","ISBN":"978-0-674-97527-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"116","publisher":"Harvard UP","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","title":"Political Violence in Ancient India","type":"book"},

  {"id":"SinhaI 2019a","abstract":"The early Buddhist texts record that Buddha announced his approaching nirvana to the monks at vaishali. According to historical traditions, monks followed him as he departed from Vaishali after delivering the last sermon. Buddha persuaded them to return back and presented his alms-bowl to them as memorial. To commemorate that event a stupa was built there which is now identified with kesariya stupa (in Bihar) and which falls en route from Vaishali to Kushinagar (in eastern Uttar Pradesh) where Buddha attained nirvana. This stupa finds reference in the travelogues of Fa Xian and Xuan Zang, the two celebrated Chinese monks of fifth and seventh century CE respectively. Briefly mentioned by Alexander Cunningham in 1861-62, the stupa mound at Kesariya was subjected to meticulous excavation from 1997-98 onwards by Archaeological Survey of India which is still continuing. The unearthed brick stupa is datable to Gupta period (5th-6th century CE) although an earlier phase datable to Sunga-Satavahana period (1st-2nd century CE) was also traced below it. The stupa is a six terraced structure with a cylindrical drum atop and a group of cells, with intervening polygonal designs, on each terrace enshrining stucco image of Buddha. With an extant height of about 31.5 metres and a diameter of about 123 metres, it is undoubtedly one of the tallest\nand most voluminous stupas in India. But it is most notable for its unique architecture. It can also be compared, although in a very limited sense, with the Borobudur stupa of Java islands (Indonesia) in south east Asia. With many features hitherto not found elsewhere, this stupa provides ample scope of intensive as well as extensive research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinha","given":"Ishani"}],"citation-key":"SinhaI 2019a","container-title":"Proceeding of the International Conference on Archaeology, History and Heritage","DOI":"10.17501/26510243.2019.1103","file":"Sinha-2019-kesariya-stupa-recently-excavated-architectural-marvel.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"27–31","title":"Kesariya Stupa: Recently Excavated Architectural Marvel","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://tiikmpublishing.com/data/conferences/doi/icahh/26510243.2019.1103.pdf","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"StevensonI 1997a","abstract":"Based on some 30 years of research on people who claim to remember past lives, this work encompasses the full spectrum of theory and case study on the subject to date. Early in his investigations, Stevenson became aware that some who remember past lives had birthmarks or birth defects that corresponded to wounds, usually fatal, on the person whose life was remembered. The work suggests surprising answers to such questions as the following: Why does someone born with a birth defect have the one he or she has, instead of another one? Why do some children show phobias in early infancy when they have had no traumatic experiences and no model for the phobia in their family? Why are some monozygotic (one-egg) twins markedly different from each other? Why do many boys who later become homosexual show effeminate behavior in infancy before their parents can have influenced them to do so?Writing as a scientist and a Western medical professional. Stevenson realizes that the idea that wounds on a deceased person can influence the embryo of a later-born baby is subversive of many assumptions of modern biology. Knowing that each individual case has some flaw or weakness, he decided to publish the entire corpus of cases of this sort. Photographs of birthmarks and illustrations of weapons form part of the evidence in this daring and explorative reaearch. This work will be of particular interest to physicians, psychiatrists, biologists, and anthropologists. In addition, those concerned with paranormal phenomena and the mind-brain problem will find this work challenging.","author":[{"family":"Stevenson","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"StevensonI 1997a","event-place":"Westport, Conn","file":"Stevenson-1997-reincarnation-and-biology-1.pdf;Stevenson-1997-reincarnation-and-biology-2.pdf","ISBN":"978-0-275-95282-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"language":"English","note":"attachment-label: Large PDFs—Volume 1;Volume 2","number-of-pages":"2314","publisher":"Praeger","publisher-place":"Westport, Conn","title":"Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks (Volume 1) and Birth Defects (Volume 2)","type":"book"},

  {"id":"TaylorMc 2021a","abstract":"Visnu is a central deity in the Hindu pantheon, especially in his manifestation as the seductive cattle-herding youth, Krsna. The puranas are sacred texts, which, as the Sanskrit name implies, are collections of narratives from ‘long ago’. The Visnu Purana is thus an ancient account of the universe and guide to life, which places Visnu-Krsna at the centre of creation, theology and reality itself. This text, composed about 1,500 years ago, provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the most important themes and narratives that constitute the Hindu imagination: the creation and destruction of the universe, the origin of gods and mortals, the peopling of the world, and the structure and conduct of ideal brahminical society. The Visnu Purana describes the trials of exemplary devotees, the existential struggles between gods and demons, and the exploits of legendary cultural heroes. It also contains many ecstatic songs of praise for the deity. The ever-popular accounts of Krsna’s love games with the cattle-herding girls of Vrndavana, which have proliferated in literature, dance, song and visual arts over the millennia, are found here in authoritative form. This faithful yet fluent blank-verse rendering of this great Hindu classic is the first new English translation in nearly 200 years. It will be welcomed by the scholarly community, while remaining readily accessible to a general readership.","citation-key":"TaylorMc 2021a","contributor":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"McComas"}],"event-place":"Acton, ACT","file":"Taylor-2021-the-visnu-purana.pdf","ISBN":"978-1-76046-440-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"578","publisher":"ANU Press Languages","publisher-place":"Acton, ACT","title":"The Visnu Purana: Ancient Annals of the God with Lotus Eyes","type":"book"},

The argument about how altruism binds societies together has proved a powerful tool in the analysis of welfare provision.

  {"id":"UnderhillE 1911a","abstract":"Evelyn Underhill was a poet, novelist, pacifist, and mystic, in addition to being a poet and novelist. Many of her acquaintances referred to her as \"Mrs. Moore.\" She was a prolific novelist who wrote over 30 works under her maiden name, Underhill, or the alias \"John Cordelier,\" like in the instance of The Spiral Way, published in 1912. Initially an agnostic, she gradually developed an interest in Neoplatonism and, against her husband's reservations, was gradually converted to Catholicism, finally becoming a renowned Anglo-Catholic.Baron Friedrich von Hügel, her spiritual tutor from 1921 to 1924, was complimentary of her writing but concerned about her reliance on mysticism, encouraging her to adopt a far more Christocentric vision than the theistic and intellectual one she had previously maintained.First published in 1911, this book is Evelyn Underhill's primary work about mysticism. \"The Mystic Fact\" and \"The Mystic Way\" are the book's two main sections. In the first section, Underhill takes a historical look at mysticism's theological, psychological, and philosophical foundations. Underhill discusses the use of mysticism in one's life as a means of spiritual growth in the second section.Mysticism by Evelyn Underhill provides a fantastic introduction to the search for Reality through mysticism as well as an almost comprehensive exploration of the subject. For the sake of easy readability, this version has omitted the Bibliography and Index sections, along with footnotes that readers felt made it academic and rather “heavy reading.”","author":[{"family":"Underhill","given":"Evelyn"}],"citation-key":"UnderhillE 1911a","event-place":"London","file":"Underhill-1911-mysticism.pdf","issued":{"date-parts":[["1911"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"600","publisher":"Methuen & Co.

Included are teachings on mindfulness (Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta); on morality, concentration, and wisdom (Subha Sutta); on dependent origination (Mahānidrāna Sutta); on the roots and causes of wrong views (Brahmajāla Sutta); and a long description of the Buddha’s last days and passing away (Mahāparinibbāna Sutta); along with a wealth of practical advice and insight for all those travelling along the spiritual path.\n\nVenerable Sumedho Thera writes in his foreword: “[These suttas] are not meant to be ‘sacred scriptures’ that tell us what to believe. One should read them, listen to them, think about them, contemplate them, and investigate the present reality, the present experience, with them. Then, and only then, can one insightfully know the truth beyond words.”\n\nIntroduced with a vivid account of the Buddha’s life and times and a short survey of his teachings, The Long Discourses of the Buddha brings us closer in every way to the wise and compassionate presence of Gotama Buddha and his path of truth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,6]]},"citation-key":"Walshe 1995a","collection-title":"Teachings of the Buddha","contributor":[{"family":"Walshe","given":"Maurice"}],"file":"","ISBN":"978-0-86171-103-1","language":"en","title":"The Long Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Dīgha Nikāya","title-short":"The Long Discourses of the Buddha","type":"book","URL":"https://wisdomexperience.org/product/long-discourses-buddha/"},
  {"id":"Warder 1970a","abstract":"This volume describes the Buddhism of India on the basis of the comparison of all the available sources in various languages. It falls into three approximately equal parts. The first is a reconstruction of the original Buddhism presupposed by the traditions of the different schools known to us. It uses primarily the established methods of textual criticism, drawing out of the oldest extant texts of the different schools their common kernel. This kernel of doctrine is presumably common Buddhism of the period before the great schisms of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. It may be substantially the Buddhism of the Buddha himself, though this cannot be proved: at any rate it is a Buddhism presupposed by the schools as existing about a 100 years after the Parinirvana of the Buddha, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was formulated by anyone other than the Buddha and his immediate followers. The second part traces the development of the \"Eighteen Schools\" of early Buddhism, showing how they elaborated their doctrines out of the common kernel. Here we can see to what extent the Sthaviravada, or \"Theravada\" of the Pali tradition, among others, added to or modified the original doctrine. The third part describes the Mahayana movement and the Mantrayana, the way of the bodhisattva and the way of ritual. The relationship of the Mahayana to the early schools is traced in detail, with its probable affiliation to one of them, the Purva Saila, as suggested by the consensus of the evidence. Particular attention is paid in this book to the social teaching of Buddhism, the part that relates to the \"world\" rather than to nirvana and which has been generally neglected in modern writings on Buddhism.","author":[{"family":"Warder","given":"A.

  {"id":"WarderAK 1956a","abstract":"In investigating the nature of original Buddhism a consideration of its position as one among a number of contemporary historical systems, and of the way in which it may have arisen in opposition to the others, may be more illuminating than attempts to trace back the original doctrine through the history of the schools of Buddhism itself. The most important among these systems appear to have been those of the Ājīvakas, the Nirgranthas or Jainas, and the Lokayatas. Many other systems existed, and are occasionally discussed in the extant literature, but the majority failed to attract a substantial following and to persist as organized schools. We may mention the doctrines attributed to the Buddha's teachers, and perhaps the Iśvaravāda, if this was not simply a part of the older Brahmanical tradition (Iśvara = Prajapāti or Brahmā). The cults of Baladeva and Vāsudeva, which with the Kṛṣṇa and other legends were later integrated into Vaisnavism, and which probably were non-Brahmanical in origin, seem from Jaina references to have existed already in eastern India. A heterodox proto- may date back to the period of the origin of Buddhism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Warder","given":"A.

  {"id":"WijayaratnaM 1990a","abstract":"This book provides a brief yet detailed account of the ideal way of life prescribed for Buddhist monks and nuns in the Pali texts of the Theravada school of Buddhism. The author describes the way in which the Buddha's disciples institutionalized his teachings about such things as food, dress, money, chastity, solitude and discipleship. This tradition represents an ideal of religious life that has been followed in South and Southeast Asia for over two thousand years. In previous writing on the early period of Buddhist monasticism, scholars have usually tried to give an historical account of the evolution of the monastic order, and so have seen the extant Vinaya texts as coming from distinct historical periods. This book takes a different approach by presenting a synchronic account, which allows the author to show that sources are in fact predominantly consistent and coherent.","author":[{"family":"Wijayaratna","given":"Mohan"}],"citation-key":"WijayaratnaM 1990a","event-place":"Cambridge England ; New York","file":"Wijayaratna-1990-buddhist-monastic-life.pdf","ISBN":"978-0-521-36708-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"214","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge England ; New York","title":"Buddhist Monastic Life: according to the texts of the Theravada tradition","type":"book"},

In this book Kenneth Zysk show that Buddhist scriptures some centuries older than this contain abundant information about medical practices, and are our earliest evidence for a rational approach to medicine in India. He argues that Buddhism and the medical tradition were mutually supportive: that Buddhist monks and people associated with them contributed to the development of medicine, while skills as physical as well as spiritual healers enhanced their reputation and popular support. Drawing on a wide range of textual, archaeological, and secondary sources, Zysk first present an overview of the history of Indian Medicine in its religious context. He then examines primary literature from the Pali Buddhist Canon and from the Sanskrit treatises of Bhela, Caraka, and Susruta.
