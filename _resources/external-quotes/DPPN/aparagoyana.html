<h3>Aparagoyāna</h3>
<p>One of the four great continents into which the earth is divided. It is to the west of Sineru and is seven thousand leagues (<em>yojana</em>) in extent. It is surrounded by five hundred islands (SnA.ii.443). According to the Aṅguttaranikāya (i.227; v.59), each world-system (<em>cakkavāḷa</em>) has an Aparagoyāna. It is inhabited by men (KhA.123), but they have no houses and sleep on the ground (ThagA.ii.187‑8). In the centre of the continent is a Kadamba tree, whose trunk is fifteen leagues in girth and whose trunk and arms are fifty leagues in length.</p>
<p>This tree stands for a whole world-cycle (DhsA.298; AA.i.264; Vm.206). When the sun rises in Jambudīpa, it is the middle watch of the night in Aparagoyāna; sunset in Aparagoyāna is midnight in Jambudīpa, and sunrise is noon in Jambudīpa, sunset in Pubbavideha and midnight in Uttarakuru (DA.iii.868). A Cakkavatti-king first conquers Pubbavideha in the east and Jambudīpa in the south, and then sets out to win Aparagoyāna in the west and Uttarakuru in the north (Mbv.73‑4; BuA.113). Thus King Mandhātu, having conquered Jambudīpa, journeys on with his retinue to Aparagoyāna and conquers it straight away (Dvy.215).</p>
<p>The <em>yakkha </em>Puṇṇaka, in his game of dice with Dhanañjaya,¹ staked a jewel, by gazing into which the continent of Aparagoyāna could be seen. So also in the necklace mentioned in the Hārapradāna Jātaka. (Mtu.ii.68).</p>
<p>In this context the name given is Goyāniya. So also in the Mahāvastu: Aparagodānika, °godāniya (ii.159, 378, etc.). In the Dulva it is called Aparagaudani (Rockhill, 84).</p>
<p>Some of the inhabitants came with Mandhātu from Aparagoyāna to Jambudīpa and settled down there. The country they colonised was called Aparanta. DA.ii.482; MA.i.484.</p>
