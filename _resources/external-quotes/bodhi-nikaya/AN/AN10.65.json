Then the wanderer Sāmaṇḍakāni [121] approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:</p> <p>“Friend Sāriputta, what is happiness? What is suffering?” “Rebirth, friend, is suffering. No rebirth is happiness. When there is rebirth, this suffering is to be expected: cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, and urination; being afflicted by fire, sticks, or knives; and relatives and friends get together and scold one. When there is rebirth, this suffering is to be expected.</p> <p>“When there is no rebirth, this happiness is to be expected: no cold, no heat, no hunger, no thirst, no defecation, and no urination; no being afflicted by fire, sticks, or knives; and relatives and friends don’t get together and scold one. When there is no rebirth, this happiness is to be expected.”</p>"
