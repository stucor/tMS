    "Quote": "<p><p><strong><em lang='sa-Latn'>Brahmā</em></strong> is a leading God (deva) and heavenly king in Buddhism. He is considered as a protector of teachings (<em>dharmapala</em>), and he is never depicted in early Buddhist texts as a creator god. In Buddhist tradition, it was the deity Brahma Sahampati who appeared before the Buddha and invited him to teach, once the Buddha attained enlightenment.</p><p>Brahma lords over the heavenly realm of rebirth called the <em>Brahmaloka,</em> one of the highest realms in Buddhist cosmology. Brahma is generally represented in Buddhist culture as a god with four faces and four arms, and variants of him are found in Mahayana Buddhist cultures.</p>"
