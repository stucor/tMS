    "Quote": "<p>The <em><strong>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</strong></em> (Sanskrit: <span lang=\"sa\">बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद्</span>, <small>romanized: </small><em lang=\"sa-Latn\">bṛhadāraṇyaka upaniṣad</em>) is one of the Principal Upanishads and one of the first Upanishadic scriptures of Hinduism. A key scripture to various schools of Hinduism, the <em>Brihadaranyaka Upanisad</em> is tenth in the Muktikā or \"canon of 108 Upanishads\".</p><p>The <em>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</em> is estimated to have been composed about 7th–6th century BCE, excluding some parts estimated to have been composed after the <em>Chandogya Upanishad</em>. The Sanskrit language text is contained within the <em>Shatapatha Brahmana</em>, which is itself a part of the Shukla Yajur Veda.</p><p>The <em>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</em> is a treatise on Ātman (Self), includes passages on metaphysics, ethics, and a yearning for knowledge that influenced various Indian religions, ancient and medieval scholars, and attracted secondary works such as those by Adi Shankara and Madhvacharya.</p>"
