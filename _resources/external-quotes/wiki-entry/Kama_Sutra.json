    "Quote": "<p>The <em><strong>Kama Sutra</strong></em> (<abbr>lit.</abbr>&thinsp;'Principles of Love') is an ancient Indian Hindu Sanskrit text on sexuality, eroticism and emotional fulfillment. Attributed to Vātsyāyana, the <em>Kamasutra</em> is neither exclusively nor predominantly a sex manual on sex positions, but rather a guide on the art of living well, the nature of love, finding partners, maintaining sex life, and other aspects pertaining to pleasure-oriented faculties. It is a <em>sutra</em>-genre text with terse aphoristic verses that have survived into the modern era with different <em>bhāṣya</em>s (commentaries). The text is a mix of prose and anustubh-meter poetry verses.</p>"
