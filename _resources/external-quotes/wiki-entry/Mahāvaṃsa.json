    "Quote": "<p><em><strong>Mahāvaṃsa</strong></em> (Sinhala: මහාවංශ (Mahāvansha), Pali: <em>මහාවංස (Mahāvaṃsa)</em>) is the meticulously kept historical chronicle of Sri Lanka until the period of Mahasena of Anuradhapura. It was written in the style of an epic poem written in the Pali language. It relates the history of Sri Lanka from its legendary beginnings up to the reign of Mahasena of Anuradhapura covering the period between the arrival of Prince Vijaya from India in 543 BCE to his reign and later updated by different writers. It was first composed by a Buddhist monk named Mahanama at the Mahavihara temple in Anuradhapura in the 5th or 6th-century CE.</p>"
