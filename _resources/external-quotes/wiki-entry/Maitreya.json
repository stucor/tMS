    "Quote": "<p><strong>Maitreya</strong> (Sanskrit) or <strong>Metteyya</strong> (Pali), is a bodhisattva who is regarded as the future Buddha of this world in all schools of Buddhism, prophesied to become <strong>Maitreya Buddha</strong> or <strong>Metteyya Buddha</strong>. In some Buddhist literature, such as the <em>Amitabha Sutra</em> and the <em>Lotus Sutra</em>, he is also referred to as <strong>Ajitā</strong> (Invincible, Unconquerable). In Tibetan Buddhism he is known as the “Lord of Love” or the “Noble Loving One” (<strong>Pakpa Jampa</strong>). The root of his name is the Sanskrit word <em>maitrī</em> (Pali: <em>metta</em>; meaning friendliness, loving-kindness). The name Maitreya is also related to the Indo-Iranian name Mitra.</p><p>In all branches of Buddhism, Maitreya is viewed as the direct successor of Gautama Buddha. As the fifth and final Buddha of the current kalpa (eon), Maitreya's teachings will be focused around re-establishing the Buddha's Dharma on Earth. According to scriptures, Maitreya's teachings will be similar to those of Gautama (Śākyamuni). The arrival of Maitreya is prophesied to occur during an era of decline when the teachings of Gautama Buddha have been disregarded or largely forgotten.</p>"
