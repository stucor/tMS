    "Quote": "<p>I translate on the basis of BBS and SBJ (supported by a 1937 Sinhala edition) rather than PTS. Both BBS and SBJ abridge the passage; where PTS reads <em>kāyū&shy;pa&shy;saṁ&shy;hi&shy;taṁ</em> and <em>dham&shy;mūpa&shy;saṁ&shy;hi&shy;taṁ</em>, these two eds. read <em>kām&shy;ūpa&shy;saṁ&shy;hi&shy;taṁ</em> in both places, a significant difference. I am told that the Chinese translation of the Madhyama Āgama (the Skt counterpart of MN) has a reading that corresponds to that of BBS and SBJ. The Chinese version mentions all four jhānas.</p>",
