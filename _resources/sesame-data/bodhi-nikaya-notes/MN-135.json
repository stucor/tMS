    "Quote": "<p>The Pali reads <em>ekāyano ayaṁ bhikkhave maggo</em>, and virtually all translators understand this as a statement upholding <em>satipatṭ̣hāna </em>as an exclusive path. Thus Ven. Soma renders it: “This is the only way, O bhikkhus,” and Ven. Nyanaponika: “This is the sole way, monks.” Ñm, however, points out that <em>ekāyana magga</em> at MN 12.37–42 has the unambiguous contextual meaning of “a path that goes in one way only,” and so he rendered the phrase in this passage, too. The expression used here, “the direct path,” is an attempt to preserve this meaning in a more streamlined phrasing. MA explains <em>ekāyana magga</em> as a single path, not a divided path; as a way that has to be walked by oneself alone, without a companion; and as a way that goes to one goal, Nibbāna. Though there is neither canonical nor commentarial basis for this view, it might be maintained that <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> is called <em>ekāyana magga</em>, the direct path, to distinguish it from the approach to meditative attainment that proceeds through the jhānas or <em>brahmavihāras</em>. While the latter can lead to Nibbāna, they do not do so necessarily but can lead to sidetracks, whereas <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> leads invariably to the final goal.</p>",
