    "Quote": "<p>“Thus gone” is, in Pali, <em>tathāgata</em>, the usual epithet of the Buddha, but here applied more broadly to the arahant. MA interprets this passage in two alternative ways thus: (1) The arahant even while alive is here and now untraceable as a being or individual (in the sense of an abiding self) because in the ultimate sense there is no being (as self). (2) The arahant is untraceable here and now because it is impossible for the gods, etc., to find the support for his insight-mind, path-mind, or fruition-mind (<em>vipassanācitta</em>, <em>maggacitta</em>, <em>phalacitta</em>); that is, the object being Nibbāna, his mind cannot be known by the worldling.</p>",
