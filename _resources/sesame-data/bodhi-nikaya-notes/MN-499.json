    "Quote": "<p>The <em>Mūlapariyāya Sutta</em> (MN 1) was also delivered by the Buddha while he was living in the Subhaga Grove at Ukkaṭṭhā, and the similarity in formulation and theme between these two suttas—perhaps the only two recorded as originating at Ukkaṭṭhā—is striking. It is even possible to see the present sutta as a dramatic representation of the same ideas set forth by the <em>Mūlapariyāya </em>in abstract philosophical terms. Thus Baka the Brahmā may be taken to represent being (<em>bhava</em>) or personality (<em>sakkāya</em>) in its most eminent form, blindly engaged in the activity of conceiving (<em>maññanā</em>), sustaining itself with its delusions of permanence, pleasure, and selfhood. Underlying being is craving, symbolised by Māra—seemingly inconspicuous in the assembly, yet the real author of all the outpourings of conceiving, the one who holds the entire universe in his grip. The alliance of Brahmā and Māra, God and Satan, an incomprehensible union from the perspective of Western theism, points to the thirst for continued being as the hidden root of all world affirmation, whether theistic or non-theistic. In the sutta the superficial theoretical contest between Baka and the Buddha soon gives way to a gripping deep-level confrontation between Māra and the Buddha—M̄ara as craving demanding the affirmation of being, the Enlightened One pointing to the cessation of being through the uprooting of delight.</p>",
