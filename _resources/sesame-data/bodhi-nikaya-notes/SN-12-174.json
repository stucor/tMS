    "Quote": "<p>Spk: The kamma of the arahant is similar to the sunbeam. However, the sunbeam does exist, but because there is no place for it to settle it is said to be unestablished (<em>appatiṭṭhitā</em>). But the arahant’s kamma is said to be unestablished because it is nonexistent. Although he has a body, etc., no wholesome or unwholesome kamma is thereby created. His deeds are merely functional, not productive of results (<em>kiriyamatte ṭhatvā avipākaṃ hoti</em>). In this connection, see <strong>12:25</strong> and <strong>n. 81</strong>.</p><p>It should be noted that Spk explains the statement that the arahant’s <em>consciousness</em> is unestablished to mean that his kamma is unestablished. This seems too free an interpretation. Nevertheless, I think it would be wrong to interpret the sutta as saying that after his parinibbāna the arahant’s consciousness persists in some mode that can only be described as unestablished. The present passage is clearly speaking of the arahant’s consciousness <em>while he is alive</em>. Its purport is not that an “unestablished consciousness” remains after the arahant’s parinibbāna, but that his consciousness, being devoid of lust, does not “become established in” the four nutriments in any way that might generate a future existence.</p>",
