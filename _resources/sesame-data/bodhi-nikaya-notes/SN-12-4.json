    "Quote": "<p>On the meaning of <em>bhava</em>, see the General Introduction, pp. 52-53. Spk: In the exposition of existence, <em>sense-sphere existence</em> is both kamma-existence (<em>kammabhava</em>) and rebirth-existence (<em>upapattibhava</em>). Of these, <em>kamma-existence</em> is just kamma that leads to sense-sphere existence; for the kamma, being the cause for rebirth-existence in that realm, is spoken of as “existence” by assigning the name of the result to the cause. <em>Rebirth-existence</em> is the set of five kammically  acquired aggregates produced by that kamma; for this is called “existence” in the sense that “it comes to be there.” The same method of explanation applies to form-sphere and formless-sphere existence (except that in formless-sphere rebirth-existence only the four mental aggregates exist).</p><p>It should be noted that in interpreting the expression <em>upādānapaccayā bhavo</em>, the commentaries take <em>bhava</em> as either <em>kammabhava</em> or <em>upapattibhava</em>, since both volitional activity and rebirth are conditioned by clinging; but in the expression <em>bhavapaccayā jāti</em>, they confine <em>bhava</em> to <em>kammabhava</em>, since <em>upapattibhava</em> includes <em>jāti</em> and thus cannot be a condition for it. See Vism 572-73 (Ppn17:258-60) and Vism 575 (Ppn 17:270).</p>"
