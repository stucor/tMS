    "Quote": "<p>The “internal” (<em>ajjhattika</em> = <em>adhi</em> + <em>atta</em> + <em>ika</em>) exclusively denotes the six sense faculties, and is contrasted with “external” (<em>bāhira</em>), which exclusively denotes the six sense objects (though according to the Abhidhamma, <em>dhammāyatana</em> denotes the objects of <em>manoviññāṇa</em> and the mental concomitants of all <em>viññāṇa</em>). Despite the similarity, the dyad <em>ajjhattika–bāhira</em> is <em>not</em> synonymous with the dyad <em>ajjhatta–bahiddhā</em>; the latter marks the distinction between what pertains to oneself and what is external to oneself. The sense faculties of other beings are <em>ajjhattika</em> but <em>bahiddhā</em> , while one’s own pigmentation, voice, scent, etc., are <em>ajjhatta</em> but <em>bāhira</em>.</p>",
