    "Quote": "<p>This “teaching of the Blessed One” is at Ud 81,6–10. Spk explains the connection between the teaching and the present situation thus: <em>For one who is dependent</em> (<em>nissitassa</em>): “dependent” on account of craving, conceit, and views; <em>there is wavering</em> (<em>calitạ</em>): palpitation. As Channa is unable to endure the arisen pain, there is now the palpitation of one who isn’t free from the grip of such thoughts as “I am in pain, the pain is mine.” By this, he is telling him, “You’re still a worldling.” <em>No inclination</em> (<em>nati</em>): no inclination of craving. <em>No coming</em> by way of rebirth, <em>no going</em> by way of death. <em>This itself is the end of suffering</em>: this itself is the end, the termination, the limit, of the suffering of defilements and of the suffering of the round. As to those who argue that the phrase “in between the two” (ubhayamantarena) implies an intermediate state (antar̄bhava), their statement is nonsense, for the existence of an intermediate state is rejected in the Abhidhamma. Therefore the meaning is: “Neither here, nor there, nor both—the other alternative.”</p><p>Though the Theravāda Abhidhamma (see Kvu 362–66) and the commentaries argue against the existence of an <em>antarābhava</em>, a number of canonical texts seem to support this notion. See below <strong>n. 382</strong>, and <strong>V, n. 65</strong>.</p>"
