    "Text": "<p><em><strong>Advaita Vedanta</strong></em> is a Hindu tradition of textual exegesis and philosophy that states that <em>jivatman</em>, the individual experiencing self, is ultimately pure awareness mistakenly identified with body and the senses, and non-different (”na aparah”) from <em>Ātman/Brahman</em>, the highest Self or Reality. The term <em>Advaita</em> literally means “non-secondness”, but is usually rendered as “nonduality”, referring to the Oneness of Brahman, the only real Existent, and often equated with monism.</p><p>Advaita Vedanta is a Hindu sādhanā, a path of spiritual discipline and experience, and states that <em>moksha</em> (liberation from  ‘suffering’ and rebirth) is attained through knowledge of Brahman, recognizing the illusoriness of the phenomenal world and disidentification from the body-mind complex and the notion of ‘doership’, and acquiring <em>vidyā</em> (knowledge) of one’s true identity as <em>Atman/Brahman</em>, self-luminous (<em>svayam prakāśa</em>) awareness or Witness-consciousness. This knowledge is acquired through Upanishadic statements such as <em>tat tvam asi</em>, “that[’s how] you are,” which destroy the ignorance (<em>avidyā</em>) regarding one’s true identity by revealing that <em>(jiv)Ātman</em> is non-different from immortal <em>Brahman</em>.</p><p>The Advaita vedanta tradition modifies the Samkhya-dualism between <em>Purusha</em> (pure awareness or consciousness) and <em>Prakriti</em> (‘nature’, which includes matter but also cognition and emotion) as the two equal basic principles of existence, proposing instead that <em>Atman/Brahman</em> (awareness, <em>purusha</em>) alone is ultimately real, and, though unchanging, the cause and origin of the transient phenomenal world (<em>prakriti</em>). In this view, the <em>jivatman</em> or individual self is a mere reflection or limitation of singular <em>Ātman</em> in a multitude of apparent individual bodies. It regards the material world as an illusory appearance (<em>maya</em>) or “an unreal manifestation (<em>vivarta</em>) of Brahman,” the latter as proposed by the 13th century scholar Prakasatman of the Vivarana school.</p><p>Advaita Vedanta is often presented as an elite scholarly tradition belonging to the orthodox Hindu Vedānta tradition, emphasizing scholarly works written in Sanskrit; as such, it is an “iconic representation of Hindu religion and culture.” Yet contemporary Advaita Vedanta is yogic Advaita, a medieval and modern syncretic tradition incorporating Yoga and other traditions, and producing works in vernacular. The earliest Advaita writings are the Sannyasa Upanishads (first centuries CE), the <em>Vākyapadīya</em>, written by Bhartṛhari (second half 5th century,) and the <em>Māndūkya-kārikā</em> written by Gauḍapāda (7th century). Gaudapada adapted philosophical concepts from Buddhism, giving them a Vedantic basis and interpretation. The Buddhist concepts were further Vedanticised by Adi Shankara (8th c. CE), who is generally regarded as the most prominent exponent of the Advaita Vedānta tradition, though some of the most prominent Advaita-propositions come from other Advaitins, and his early influence has been questioned. Adi Shankara emphasized that, since Brahman is ever-present, Brahman-knowledge is immediate and requires no ‘action’ or ‘doership’, that is, striving (to attain) and effort. Nevertheless, the Advaita tradition, as represented by Mandana Misra and the <em>Bhamati</em> school, also prescribes elaborate preparatory practice, including contemplation of the mahavakyas, posing a paradox of two opposing approaches which is also recognized in other spiritual disciplines and traditions.</p><p>Shankara’s prominence as the exemplary defender of traditional Hindu-values and spirituality started to take shape only centuries later, in the 14th century, with the ascent of Sringeri matha and its <em>jagadguru</em> Vidyaranya (Madhava, 14th cent.) in the Vijayanagara Empire, While Adi Shankara did not embrace <em>Yoga</em>, the Advaita-tradition by then had accepted yogic samadhi as a means to still the mind and attain knowledge, explicitly incorporating elements from the yogic tradition and texts like the <em>Yoga Vasistha</em> and the <em>Bhagavata Purana</em>, culminating in Swami Vivekananda’s full embrace and propagation of Yogic samadhi as an Advaita means of knowledge and liberation. In the 19th century, due to the influence of Vidyaranya’s <em>Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha</em>, the importance of Advaita Vedānta was overemphasized by Western scholarship, and Advaita Vedānta came to be regarded as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality, despite the numerical dominance of theistic Bhakti-oriented religiosity. In modern times, Advaita views appear in various Neo-Vedānta movements.</p>"
