    "Text": "<p><strong>Atthasālinī</strong> (Pali; lit. “Expositor of Meaning”), also known as the <strong>Dhammasaṅgaṇī-aṭṭhakathā</strong>, is one of the Theravadin Buddhist commentaries (<em>Atthakatha</em>) on the <em>Dhammasangani</em>, the first book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. It was comp osed by Buddhaghosa, based on a Sinhalese commentary known as the <em>Mahāpaccarī</em>. The title has been translated as “The Expositor” or “Providing the Meaning”.</p><p>In addition to explaining technical terminology of Buddhist psychology—such as <em>cetasika</em> (mental factors), <em>rūpa</em> (matter), and <em>nibbāna</em>—the <em>Atthasālinī</em> also preserves information on history, geography, and doctrinal interpretation. It is widely studied among Abhidhamma students and is one of Buddhaghosa’s most well-known works.</p>"
