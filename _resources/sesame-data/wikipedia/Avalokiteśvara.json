    "Quote": "<p>In Buddhism, <strong>Avalokiteśvara</strong> (meaning &ldquo;God looking upon men with pity&rdquo;, IPA: /ˌʌvəloʊkɪˈteɪʃvərə/), also known as <strong>Lokeśvara</strong> (&ldquo;Lord of the World&rdquo;) and <strong>Chenrezig</strong> (in Tibetan), is a tenth-level bodhisattva associated with great compassion (<em>mahakaruṇā</em>). He is often associated with Amitabha Buddha. Avalokiteśvara has numerous manifestations and is depicted in various forms and styles. In some texts, he is even considered to be the source of all Hindu deities (such as Vishnu, Shiva, Saraswati, Brahma, etc).</p><p>While Avalokiteśvara was depicted as male in India, in East Asian Buddhism, Avalokiteśvara is most often depicted as a female figure known as <strong>Guanyin</strong> (in Chinese), <strong>Kannon</strong> (in Japanese), and <strong>Gwaneum</strong> (in Korean). Guanyin is also an important figure in other East Asian religions, particularly Chinese folk religion and Daoism.</p><p>Avalokiteśvara is also known for his popular mantra, <em>oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ</em>, which is the most popular mantra in Tibetan Buddhism.</p>"
