    "Text": "<p><strong>Charvaka</strong> (Sanskrit: चार्वाक; IAST: <em><strong>Cārvāka</strong></em>), also known as <em><strong>Lokāyata</strong></em>, is an ancient Indian school of materialism. It is an example of the atheistic schools in the Ancient Indian philosophies, dated 900 BCE. Charvaka holds direct perception, empiricism, and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge, embraces philosophical skepticism, and rejects ritualism. In other words, the Charvaka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional.</p><p>It was a well-attested belief system in ancient India. Brihaspati, a philosopher, is traditionally referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lokāyata philosophy, although some scholars dispute this. Charvaka developed during the Hindu reformation period in the first millennium BCE and is considered a philosophical predecessor to subsequent or contemporaneous heterodox philosophies such as Aj&ntilde;āna, Ājīvika, Jainism, and Buddhism. Its teachings have been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the shastras, sutras, and Indian epic poetry.</p><p>Charvaka is categorized as one of the <em>nāstika</em> or “heterodox” schools of Indian philosophy.</p>"
