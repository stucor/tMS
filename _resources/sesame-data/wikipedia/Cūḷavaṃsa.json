    "Text": "<p>The <em><strong>Cūḷavaṃsa</strong></em> or <em><strong>Chulavamsa</strong></em> (Pāli: &ldquo;Lesser Chronicle&rdquo;) is a historical record, written in the Pali language, of the monarchs of Sri Lanka. It covers the period from the 4th century to 1815. The <em>Cūḷavaṃsa</em> was compiled over many years by Buddhist monks, and displays a variety of epic styles. It is generally considered to be a sequel to the Mahavamsa (&ldquo;Great Chronicle&rdquo;) written in the 6th century by the monk Mahanama. The Mahavamsa and the <em>Cūḷavaṃsa</em> are sometimes thought of as a single work (referred to as the “Mahavamsa”) spanning over two millennia of Sri Lankan history.</p>"
