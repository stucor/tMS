    "Quote": "<p><strong>Kama</strong> (Sanskrit: कामदेव, IAST: <em>Kāmadeva</em>), also known as <strong>Kamadeva</strong> and <strong>Manmatha</strong>, is the Hindu god of erotic love, desire, pleasure and beauty, often portrayed alongside his consort and female counterpart, Rati. He is depicted as a handsome young man decked with ornaments and flowers, armed with a bow of sugarcane and shooting arrows of flowers.</p><p>The Atharva Veda regards Kamadeva as the wielder of the creative power of the universe, also describing him to have been &ldquo;born at first, him neither the gods nor the fathers ever equaled&rdquo;. Mentioned as a <em>manasaputra</em> (mind-born son) of the creator god Brahma in the <em>Puranas</em>, Kamadeva's most popular myth is his incineration by Shiva's third eye while the latter was meditating, and later embodied on earth as the eldest son of Krishna and his chief consort Rukmini, Pradyumna.</p>"
