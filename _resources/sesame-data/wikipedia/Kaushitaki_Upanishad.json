    "Text": "<p>The <em><strong>Kaushitaki Upanishad</strong></em> (Sanskrit: कौषीतकि उपनिषद्, <em lang='sa-Latn'>Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad</em>) is an ancient Sanskrit text contained inside the Rigveda. It is associated with the <em>Kaushitaki</em> shakha, but a Sāmānya Upanishad, meaning that it is “common” to all schools of Vedanta. It was included in Robert Hume's list of 13 Principal Upanishads, and lists as number 25 in the Muktikā canon of 108 Upanishads.</p><p>The Kaushitaki Upanishad, also known as Kaushitaki Brahmana Upanishad, is part of the <em>Kaushitaki Aranyaka</em> or the <em>Shankhayana Aranyaka</em>. The <em>Kausitaki Aranyaka</em> comprises 15 chapters and four of these chapters form the Kaushitaki Upanishad.</p>"
