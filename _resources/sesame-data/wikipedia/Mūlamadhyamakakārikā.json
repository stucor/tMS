    "Text": "<p>The <em><strong>Mūlamadhyamakakārikā </strong></em>(Devanagari: मूलमध्यमककारिका, lit. ‘Root Verses on the Middle Way’), abbreviated as <em><strong>MMK</strong></em>, is the foundational text of the Madhyamaka school of Mahāyāna Buddhist philosophy. It was composed by the Indian philosopher Nāgārjuna (around roughly 150 CE).</p><p>The MMK makes use of reductio arguments to show how <em>all</em> phenomena (<em>dharmas</em>) are empty of <em>svabhava</em> (which has been variously translated as essence, own-being, or inherent existence). The MMK is widely regarded as one of the most influential and widely studied texts in the history of Buddhist philosophy. The MMK had a major impact on the subsequent development of Buddhist thought, especially in Tibetan Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism.</p>"
