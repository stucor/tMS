    "Text": "<p><strong>Pa&ntilde;cika</strong> (Chinese: 般闍迦/散脂大將/音譯散脂迦/半支迦/般闍迦) is a yaksha and consort of Hārītī, with whom he is said to have fathered 500 children.</p><p>According to the <em>Mahavamsa</em>, Pa&ntilde;cika was the commander-in-chief of the yakṣa army of Vaiśravaṇa and had another 27 yakṣa generals under his orders.</p><p>Pa&ntilde;cika was often represented holding a lance and a bag of jewels or money together with Hariti in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, where they illustrated marital love following the intervention of the Buddha. The two figures &ldquo;were very popular in Gandhara in the latter part of the second century, and their statues are many.&rdquo; When depicted holding a spear, he also signals his role as the chief of the Yakṣas. The iconography of Pancika was eventually merged with that of Vaiśravaṇa.</p>"
