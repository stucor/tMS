    "Quote": "<p>The <strong>Taittirīya Upanishad</strong> (Devanagari: तैत्तिरीय उपनिषद्) is a Vedic era Sanskrit text, embedded as three chapters (<em>adhyāya</em>) of the Yajurveda. It is a <em>mukhya</em> (primary, principal) Upanishad, and likely composed about 6th century BC.</p><p>The Taittirīya Upanishad is associated with the Taittirīya school of the Yajurveda, attributed to the pupils of sage Vaishampayana. It lists as number 7 in the Muktika canon of 108 Upanishads.</p><p>The Taittirīya Upanishad is the seventh, eighth and ninth chapters of <em>Taittirīya Āraṇyaka</em>, which are also called, respectively, the <em>Śikṣāvallī</em>, the <em>Ānandavallī</em> and the <em>Bhṛguvallī</em>. This Upanishad is classified as part of the \"black\" Yajurveda, with the term \"black\" implying \"the un-arranged, motley collection\" of verses in Yajurveda, in contrast to the \"white\" (well arranged) Yajurveda where <em>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</em> and <em>Isha Upanishad</em> are embedded.</p><p>The Upanishad includes verses that are partly prayers and benedictions, partly instruction on phonetics and praxis, partly advice on ethics and morals given to graduating students from ancient Vedic <em>gurukula</em>-s (schools), partly a treatise on allegory, and partly philosophical instruction.</p>"
