    "Text": "<p><em><strong>Ātman</strong></em> (/ˈɑːtmən/; Sanskrit: आत्मन्) is a Sanskrit word for the true or eternal Self or the self-existent essence or impersonal witness-consciousness within each individual. Atman is conceptually different from Jīvātman, which persists across multiple bodies and lifetimes. Some schools of Indian philosophy regard the <em>Ātman</em> as distinct from the material or mortal ego (<em>Ahankara</em>), the emotional aspect of the mind (<em>Citta</em>), and existence in an embodied form (<em>Prakṛti</em>). The term is often translated as soul, but is better translated as 'Self', as it solely refers to pure consciousness or witness-consciousness, beyond identification with phenomena. In order to attain moksha (liberation), a human being must acquire self-knowledge (<em>Atma Gyaan or Brahmajnana</em>).</p><p><em>Ātman</em> is a central concept in the various schools of Indian philosophy, which have different views on the relation between <em>Atman</em>, individual Self (<em>Jīvātman</em>), supreme Self (<em>Paramātmā</em>) and, the Ultimate Reality (<em>Brahman</em>), stating that they are: completely identical (Advaita, Non-Dualist), completely different (Dvaita, Dualist), or simultaneously non-different and different (Bhedabheda, Non-Dualist + Dualist).</p><p>The six orthodox schools of Hinduism believe that there is <em>Ātman</em> in every living being (<em>jiva</em>), which is distinct from the body-mind complex. This is a major point of difference with the Buddhist doctrine of <em>Anatta</em>, which holds that in essence there is no unchanging essence or Self to be found in the empirical constituents of a living being, staying silent on <em>what</em> it is that is liberated.</p>"
