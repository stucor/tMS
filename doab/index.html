<h1 id="seg-7">Introduction</h1>
<p id="seg-8">The Buddha’s teaching called <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>, usually translated as “dependent origination”, is fundamental to the Dhamma (Truth) awakened to by the Buddha on the night of his enlightenment. The Buddha is recorded to have said:</p>
<div class="line-block-center"><p class="OAstart" id="seg-9">“One who sees dependent origination,<br>sees the Dhamma.<br>One who sees the Dhamma,<br>sees dependent origination.”</p></div>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-10"><span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;28<span class='scsegments'>:28.5–28.6, 38.7–38.8</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-11">Furthermore, the understanding of dependent origination is an integral part of the delusion-shattering insight that brings one to the state of “one who has entered the stream” (<span lang="pi">so&shy;tā&shy;pan&shy;na</span>), destined for full enlightenment within a maximum of seven more lives. It is stated by the Buddha that one who has entered the stream may be considered as possessing five attributes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p id="seg-12">Unshakeable faith in the Buddha, as opposed to other religious leaders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-13">Unshakeable faith in the Dhamma, as opposed to other religious beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-14">Unshakeable faith in the Sangha, the enlightened members of the monastic community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-15">Very high standard of morality, “dear to the enlightened ones”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-16">Accurate understanding of dependent origination, and its corollary <span lang="pi">idap&shy;pac&shy;cay&shy;atā</span> (causality).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-17"><span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;10.92<span class='scsegments'>:5.1–6.19</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-18">Therefore it is fair to say that the correct understanding of dependent origination can only be known by the enlightened ones, that is by the stream-winners, once-returners, non-returners and arahants. This goes a long way to answering the question why there is so much difference of opinion on the meaning of dependent origination.</p>
<p id="seg-19">In this essay I will discuss the meaning of the twelve factors that make up the standard description of dependent origination. Then I will analyse the nature of the causes linking each pair of neighbouring factors, using a Western model of causality. Having explained what the Buddha meant by dependent origination, I will then examine perhaps the most interesting question: Why did the Buddha place such importance on dependent origination? What is its purpose? In this final section, I will propose that the function of dependent origination is threefold:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p id="seg-20">To explain how there can be rebirth without a soul.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-21">To answer the question “What is life?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-22">To understand why there is suffering, and where suffering comes to an end.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="seg-23">So let us begin by seeing what the Buddha meant by dependent origination.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="seg-30">1.1 The meaning of the twelve factors, as defined by the Buddha</h2>
<p id="seg-31">It is important for us to understand exactly what the Buddha meant by these twelve terms. Fortunately, when the Buddha taught the Dhamma, he also explained in great detail what he meant by what he said. Admittedly, some terms would be used in slightly different contexts in different suttas. The <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12" class="sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span> (SN 12), however, is a collection of suttas that are completely concerned with <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>. The second sutta in this collection is called the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12.2" class="sesame">Vibhaṅga Sutta</span>. <span lang="pi">Vi&shy;bhaṅ&shy;ga</span> means the explanation of the terms used. As far as dependent origination is concerned, in this sutta the Buddha gives the clearest explanation of what each of these terms mean.</p>
<p id="seg-32">Using Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation of the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12.2" class="sesame">Vibhaṅga Sutta</span>, the meaning of these twelve terms will now be explained. Also, with the aid of some other suttas, the meaning of two of the most controversial terms will be clarified.</p>
<p id="seg-33">First of all, the Buddha said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-34">“What, bhikkhus, is ageing-and-death? The ageing of the various beings in the various orders of beings, their growing old, brokenness of teeth, greyness of hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of vitality, degeneration of the faculties: this is called ageing. The passing away of the various beings from the various orders of beings, their perishing, their break up, disappearance, mortality, death, completion of time, the break up of the aggregates, the laying down of the carcass: this is called death. Thus this ageing and this death are together called ageing-and-death.”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-35"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.2<span class='scsegments'>:3.1–3.7</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-36">It is quite clear here that the Buddha was talking about death in the usual meaning of the term, not a death in a moment (which is a term that some people mistakenly use). It means the death that you call an undertaker to settle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-37">“And what, bhikkhus, is birth? The birth of the various beings into the various orders of beings, their being born, descent (into the womb), production (<span lang="pi">ab&shy;hi&shy;nib&shy;bat&shy;ti</span> = rebirth), the manifestation of the aggregates, the obtaining of the sense bases. This is called birth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-38"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.2<span class='scsegments'>:4.1–4.3</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-39">The meaning of the term “various orders of beings”, is fully brought out by a passage in another sutta specifically dealing with dependent origination, the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn15" class="sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-40">“With birth as condition there is ageing-and-death. How that is so, Ānanda, should be understood in this way. If there were absolutely and utterly no birth of any kind anywhere—that is, of gods into the state of gods, of celestials into the state of celestials, of spirits, demons, human beings, quadrupeds, winged creatures, reptiles, each into their own state—if there were no birth of beings, of any sort into any state, then, in the complete absence of birth, with the cessation of birth, would ageing-and-death be discerned?”</p>
<p id="seg-41">“Certainly not, venerable sir.”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-42"><span class="sclinktext">DN&#8239;15<span class='scsegments'>:4.1–4.4</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-43">Again, it is quite clear here that birth means what we would normally consider it to be: the arising in the human realm of a being in the womb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-44">“And what, bhikkhus, is existence (<span lang="pi">bhava</span>)? There are these three kinds of existence: sense-sphere existence, form-sphere existence, formless-sphere existence. This is called existence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-45"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.2<span class='scsegments'>:5.1–5.4</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-46">Because this term, <span lang="pi">bhava</span>, is often misunderstood I will explain its meaning in further detail.</p>
<p id="seg-47">The above classification of existence into three realms is sometimes called the <span lang="pi">tiloka</span>, the three worlds. The <span lang="pi">kā&shy;ma&shy;lo&shy;ka</span> are the worlds dominated by the five senses. They are the human realm, the animal realm, the realm of ghosts, the hell realms and the deva realms up to, but not including the <span lang="pi">brah&shy;ma&shy;lo&shy;ka</span>. The <span lang="pi">rū&shy;pa&shy;lo&shy;ka</span> are the silent worlds wherein one exists in the jhāna attainments. They begin with the <span lang="pi">brah&shy;ma&shy;lo&shy;ka</span> and include several other realms based on higher jhānas. The <span lang="pi">arūpa&shy;loka</span> are the worlds of pure mind, wherein one exists in one of the four immaterial attainments. The <span lang="pi">rū&shy;pa&shy;lo&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">arūpa&shy;loka</span> are the jhāna experiences attained at the moment of death that continues for vast periods of time, transcending cataclysms of universes and counted in, sometimes, thousands of aeons.</p>
<p id="seg-48">To understand the full meaning of <span lang="pi">bhava</span> one has to go to the Aṅguttara Nikāya (<span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.76</span>), where Venerable Ānanda asks the Buddha, “What is <span lang="pi">bhava</span>?” The Buddha responds by questioning Ānanda: “If there was no <span lang="pi">kamma</span> ripening in the <span lang="pi">kā&shy;ma&shy;lo&shy;ka</span>, would there be existence in the realm dominated by the five senses?” He then asks the same about the other two realms: “If there was no <span lang="pi">kamma</span> ripening in the <span lang="pi">rū&shy;pa&shy;lo&shy;ka</span>, would there be existence in the <span lang="pi">rū&shy;pa&shy;lo&shy;ka</span>?” “If there was no <span lang="pi">kamma</span> ripening in the <span lang="pi">arūpa&shy;loka</span>, would there be existence in the <span lang="pi">arūpa&shy;loka</span>?” Accordingly, Ānanda replies “certainly not” to each question. The Buddha then further explains: “So, Ānanda, you can regard <span lang="pi">kamma</span> [the actions of body, speech and mind] as the field, you can regard consciousness as the seed, and you can regard craving as the moisture. Thus, for beings who are blinded by ignorance and fettered by craving, there is the establishment of the consciousness in this lower realm [in the <span lang="pi">hīna&shy;dhā&shy;tu</span>, ie. the realms dominated by the five senses; and so forth for the two higher realms of existence]. Thus there is in the future more existence [<span lang="pi">pun&shy;ab&shy;bha&shy;va</span>], rebirth [<span lang="pi">ab&shy;hi&shy;nib&shy;bat&shy;ti</span>]”. Here the Buddha was giving the simile of plants growing, with <span lang="pi">kamma</span> as the field, and consciousness as the seed, which is fed by the moisture of craving to explain how <span lang="pi">bhava</span> is a cause for rebirth (<span lang="pi">jāti</span>).</p>

</div>
<p id="seg-58">The meaning of <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> is sometimes debated because this is a word that does have many meanings in different places. If one wishes to see the word <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> used as a cause for rebirth, one can go to the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn120" class="sesame">Saṅkhārupapatti Sutta</span>. <span lang="pi">Saṅk&shy;hār&shy;upa&shy;pat&shy;ti</span> means “rebirth according to <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span>”. Here, the Buddha talks about how certain beings arise in different realms according to their planned actions of body, speech or mind. These are actions of body, speech and mind, which are accompanied by will (<span lang="pi">cetanā</span>); and it is this <span lang="pi">kamma</span> which gives rise to future rebirth. This is called <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-59">In another sutta (SN 12.51:9.1–9.3) the Buddha talks about how, if a person who has ignorance (<span lang="pi">avij&shy;jāg&shy;ato</span>, “who has gone to ignorance”) plans a meritorious <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> (<span lang="pi">puññaṁ saṅ&shy;khā&shy;raṁ ab&shy;hi&shy;saṅk&shy;haro&shy;ti</span>), his consciousness goes to a meritorious place. If he plans a demeritorious <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> (<span lang="pi">apuññaṁ saṅ&shy;khā&shy;raṁ ab&shy;hi&shy;saṅk&shy;haro&shy;ti</span>), his consciousness goes to an <span lang="pi">apuñña</span> place, a demeritorious place. If he plans an <span lang="pi">āneñja saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> (<span lang="pi">āneñja</span> being something in-between), then his consciousness goes to that place accordingly. Again, this shows that there are three types of <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span>—meritorious, demeritorious and in-between—and that <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> is the working of <span lang="pi">kamma</span>. In much the same way that <span lang="pi">kamma</span> can be made by body, speech and mind, so too there are three types of <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span>—body, speech and mind <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span>.</p>

<p id="seg-60">“And what, bhikkhus, is ignorance (<span lang="pi">avijjā</span>)? Not knowing suffering, not knowing the origin of suffering, not knowing the cessation of suffering, not knowing the way leading to the cessation of suffering. This is called ignorance.”</p>

<h2 id="seg-62">1.2 Causality and the twelve factors</h2>
<p id="seg-63">Alongside dependent origination, the Buddha also taught <span lang="pi">idap&shy;pac&shy;cay&shy;atā</span>, causality. The standard formula of causality is as follows:</p>
<div class="line-block-center"><p class="OAstart" id="seg-64">“When this is, that is.<br>From the arising of this, that arises.<br>When this is not, that is not.<br>From the ceasing of this, that ceases.”<br><br><span lang="pi">Iti imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti,<br>im&shy;as&shy;sup&shy;pādā idaṁ uppajjati.<br>Imasmiṁ asati idaṁ na hoti,<br>imassa nirodhā idaṁ ni&shy;ruj&shy;jha&shy;ti.</span></p></div>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-65"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.21<span class='scsegments'>:1.8–1.9</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-66">The first feature of such causality that must be emphasized is that there can be a substantial time interval between a cause and its effect. It is a mistake to assume that the effect follows one moment after its cause, or that it appears simultaneously with its cause. In Buddhist causality, the cause and its effect can be separated by any length of time.</p>
<p id="seg-67">The above two Pali phrases <span lang="pi">imasmiṁ sati idaṁ hoti</span> and <span lang="pi">imasmiṁ asati idaṁ na hoti</span> are grammatical constructions called in Pali “locative absolutes”. In Professor A.K. Warder’s Introduction to Pali, the author states categorically that, in such a grammatical construction, the subordinate action (the cause) can precede or be simultaneous with the main action (the effect). As far as the Pali is concerned, the grammar allows the cause to precede the effect by any length of time interval.</p>
<p id="seg-68">For example, in the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12" class="sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span> the Buddha states:</p>
<div class="line-block-center"><p class="OAstart" id="seg-69">“When birth is,<br>death is.<br>From the arising of birth,<br>death arises.”</p></div>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-70"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.10<span class='scsegments'>:2.4</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-71">It has been shown already that in the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12" class="sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span> (SN 12) “birth” and “death” are to be understood in their common meanings. It is clear that birth and death do not happen simultaneously. Nor does birth precede death by just one moment. Birth can sometimes precede death by many years—80, 90, 100, even 120 years.</p>
<p id="seg-72">I have emphasized this point because of the misunderstandings about dependent origination presented by some modern authors on the subject. The fact remains that there can be a substantial time interval between a cause and its effect.</p>
<h1 id="seg-73"><span class="chapnum"> 2</span><br>On the Meaning of Sandiṭṭhika and Akālika</h1>
<p id="seg-74">Some modern writers have suggested that the effect must arise simultaneously with its cause, or arise just one moment after, for this to qualify as a Dhamma which can be “seen here and now” and be “immediate”. They argue that since the Dhamma is <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālika</span>, and dependent origination is one of the central features of the Dhamma, therefore dependent origination must be <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālika</span>. But does <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> mean “seen here and now”? Does <span lang="pi">akālika</span> mean “immediate”? As I will now show, these translations can be misleading.</p>
<p id="seg-75">The passage in the suttas which gives the clearest indication of the meaning of <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> is in the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn13" class="sesame">Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta</span> (<span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;13<span class='scsegments'>:8.1–14.5</span></span>). In this sutta, the dangers of sensual pleasures are described by seven examples of consequences to be experienced in this life, and all seven are described as <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span>. This is in contrast to the consequence of sensual pleasures described in the sutta’s next paragraph that are to be experienced after death and are called <span lang="pi">sam&shy;pa&shy;rā&shy;yi&shy;ka</span>. Clearly, <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">sam&shy;pa&shy;rā&shy;yi&shy;ka</span> are antonyms (words with opposite meanings). In this context, <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> must mean “visible in this life”. Although some Pali words carry slightly different meanings in different contexts, this is rare and it seems reasonable to assume that <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> means “visible in this life” in all other contexts as well.</p>
<p id="seg-76"><span lang="pi">San&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">kālika</span> (the opposite of <span lang="pi">akālika</span>) are used together in a revealing phrase which occurs three times in the suttas. (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;1.20<span class='scsegments'>:4.4, 5.2</span></span>, <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;4.21<span class='scsegments'>:1.7, 1.9</span></span>, and <span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;70<span class='scsegments'>:4.10, 6.15</span></span>) The phrase, with minor variations in each sutta is as follows:</p>
<div class="line-block-center"><p class="OAstart" id="seg-77">“I don’t run after what is <span lang="pi">kālika</span>,<br>having abandoned what is <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span>.<br>I run after what is <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span>,<br>having abandoned what is <span lang="pi">kālika</span>.”<br><br><span lang="pi">N’ahaṁ san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;kaṁ hitvā,<br>kālikaṁ anudhāvāmi.<br>Kālikaṁ hitvā,<br>san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;kaṁ an&shy;ud&shy;hā&shy;vā&shy;mi.</span></p></div>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<p id="seg-78">In these three contexts, <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">kālika</span> are clearly direct opposites, antonyms again. Thus it is reasonable to assume that the opposite of <span lang="pi">kālika</span>, <span lang="pi">akālika</span>, must be synonymous with <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span>. That is, <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālika</span> have essentially the same meaning. They both refer to that which is “visible in this life”.</p>
<p id="seg-79">For example, the Buddha encouraged such practices as <span lang="pi">mar&shy;aṇ&shy;as&shy;sa&shy;ti</span>, the meditation on death, and many monks, nuns and lay Buddhists practise this method of meditation with liberating results. <span lang="pi">Mara&shy;ṇas&shy;sati</span> is certainly a part of the Dhamma that is <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālika</span>. So, if these two Pali words really did mean “here and now” and “immediate”, <span lang="pi">mar&shy;aṇ&shy;as&shy;sa&shy;ti</span> would be next to impossible—one would need to be dead to be able to contemplate death in the “here and now”, “immediately”! Obviously, <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālika</span> do not have such a meaning. They both refer to something visible in this life, as opposed to what may only be known after one has died.</p>
<p id="seg-80">It is because each one of the twelve factors of dependent origination can be seen in this life, and their causal relationship can also be seen in this life, that dependent origination spanning more than one life qualifies as a Dhamma that is <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālika</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-81">You may not be able to directly see your own death, but you can see death occurring every day in the hospitals, on the television or in the newspapers. You don’t have to wait until some afterlife to understand the truth of death. You have also seen birth, maybe not your own, but that of many others. You can verify the truth of birth in this very life. Then by seeing human beings in their various stages from birth to death, you can verify in this life that birth is the cause of death. This is why the part of dependent origination “with birth as a condition, ageing-and-death” is a Dhamma that is <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālika</span>, “to be seen in this life”.</p>
<p id="seg-82">You cannot see all the twelve factors in this moment, because they do not occur all in one moment. But you can see a manifestation of each factor in this very life. That, also is why dependent origination is <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālika</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-83">You can also see in this life the causality that links each pair of neighbouring factors. Through the development of penetrating insight empowered by tranquil meditation, you can see in this life how feeling (<span lang="pi">vedanā</span>) gives rise to craving (<span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>). You can similarly witness how craving gives rise to clinging/fuel (<span lang="pi">upādāna</span>). And you can likewise understand in this life how craving and clinging/fuel produces existence (<span lang="pi">bhava</span>) and birth (<span lang="pi">jāti</span>) in the next life.</p>
<p id="seg-84">The way that one sees such causality stretching beyond death may be explained by paraphrasing the Buddha’s simile in the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn12" class="sesame">Mahāsīhanāda Sutta</span> (<span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;12<span class='scsegments'>:37.1–37.11</span></span>). One can know from data seen in this life that a person’s conduct will lead them to an unpleasant rebirth in just the same way that one can know that a person walking along a path with no fork must fall into a pit of coals further along that path. Thus, even the causality that links connected factors on either side of death also qualifies as a Dhamma which is <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālika</span>, to be seen in this life.</p>
<p id="seg-85">I have discussed this issue at length here only because the misunderstandings over the meaning of <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālika</span> have resulted in a misconceived rejection of the Buddha’s clear intention to let his dependent origination span more than one life.</p>
<h1 id="seg-86"><span class="chapnum"> 3</span><br>Causality and the Necessary and Sufficient Conditions</h1>
<p id="seg-87">I have already introduced the Buddha’s formula for causality, <span lang="pi">idap&shy;pac&shy;cay&shy;atā</span>, earlier on in this essay. Here I will show how <span lang="pi">idap&shy;pac&shy;cay&shy;atā</span> relates to what in Western logic we call a “necessary condition” and a “sufficient condition”. This modern analysis of causes throws much light on <span lang="pi">idap&shy;pac&shy;cay&shy;atā</span> and dependent origination.</p>
<p id="seg-88">A necessary condition is a cause without which there would be no effect. For example, fuel is a necessary condition for a fire. Without fuel there can be no fire. The necessary condition is expressed by the second half of <span lang="pi">idap&shy;pac&shy;cay&shy;atā</span>:</p>
<div class="line-block-center"><p class="OAstart" id="seg-89">“When this is not,<br>that is not.<br>From the ceasing of this,<br>that ceases.”</p></div>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-90"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.21<span class='scsegments'>:1.9</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-91">A sufficient condition is a cause that must always produce the effect. For example, a fire is a sufficient condition for heat. A fire must cause heat. The sufficient condition is expressed by the first half of <span lang="pi">idap&shy;pac&shy;cay&shy;atā</span>:</p>
<div class="line-block-center"><p class="OAstart" id="seg-92">“When this is,<br>that is.<br>From the arising of this,<br>that arises.”</p></div>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-93"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.21<span class='scsegments'>:1.8</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-94">In order to demonstrate the difference between these two types of causes I will use the example just given. Fuel is a necessary condition for fire, because with the ceasing of fuel, the fire ceases. But fuel is not a sufficient condition for fire, because fuel doesn’t always produce fire—some fuel remains unlit. Fire is a sufficient condition for heat, because fire must cause heat. But fire is not a necessary condition for heat, because without fire there can still be heat—heat can be generated from other sources.</p>
<p id="seg-95">So a necessary condition is a cause without which there would be no effect, and it is expressed by the second half of <span lang="pi">idap&shy;pac&shy;cay&shy;atā</span>. A sufficient condition is a cause that must produce the effect, and it is expressed by the first half of <span lang="pi">idap&shy;pac&shy;cay&shy;atā</span>. Together they make up Buddhist causality.</p>
<p id="seg-96">The “forward” order of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>, when analysed, shows that only some of the first eleven factors are a sufficient condition for the factor following. Those factors linked by a sufficient condition, meaning that the following factor must come about sooner or later as a consequence of the preceding factor, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p id="seg-97"><span lang="pi">avijjā</span>—<span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-98"><span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span>—<span lang="pi">nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-99"><span lang="pi">nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span>—<span lang="pi">saḷ&shy;āya&shy;ta&shy;na</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-100"><span lang="pi">saḷ&shy;āya&shy;ta&shy;na</span>—<span lang="pi">phassa</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-101"><span lang="pi">phassa</span>—<span lang="pi">vedanā</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-102"><span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>—<span lang="pi">upādāna</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-103"><span lang="pi">bhava</span>—<span lang="pi">jāti</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-104"><span lang="pi">jāti</span>—<span lang="pi">dukkha</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="seg-105">Thus, when there is <span lang="pi">avijjā</span>, there will inevitably occur some <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations inclining to rebirth. When there is <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span>, there must be <span lang="pi">nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span>, <span lang="pi">saḷ&shy;āya&shy;ta&shy;na</span>, <span lang="pi">phassa</span> and <span lang="pi">vedanā</span>. When there is <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>, there will be <span lang="pi">upādāna</span>. Also, <span lang="pi">bhava</span> is sufficient to produce birth (see AN 3.76). Then, most importantly, <span lang="pi">jāti</span> must produce <span lang="pi">dukkha</span>. Having been born one must suffer <span lang="pi">dukkha</span>. Therefore, the only escape from suffering is to cease being reborn. As Venerable Sāriputta said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-106">“In brief, to be reborn is <span lang="pi">dukkha</span>, not to be reborn is <span lang="pi">sukha</span> (happiness).”</p>

<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-107"><span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;10.65<span class='scsegments'>:2.2</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-108">It is of interest now to look at the links that are not sufficient conditions.</p>
<p id="seg-109"><span lang="pi">Saṅk&shy;hāra</span> is not a sufficient condition for rebirth-linking consciousness and the stream of consciousness that follows. This is because, having produced many rebirth-inclining <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations early on in one’s life, it is possible to make them all null and void (called <span lang="pi">ahosi kamma</span>) with the attainment of arahantship, which attainment eliminates the stream of consciousness that would otherwise begin at rebirth.</p>
<p id="seg-110">The fact that <span lang="pi">upādāna</span> is not a sufficient condition for <span lang="pi">bhava</span> is similar to <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> not being a sufficient condition for <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span>. Through the development of the noble eightfold path as far as full enlightenment, no new <span lang="pi">upādāna</span> is generated and all previous <span lang="pi">upādāna</span> becomes ineffective in producing a ground for a new existence or <span lang="pi">bhava</span>. The <span lang="pi">upādāna</span> previous to full enlightenment becomes, as it were, <span lang="pi">ahosi</span> <span lang="pi">upādāna</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-111">Even more obvious, <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> is not a sufficient condition for <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>. <span lang="pi">Vedanā</span> are certainly experienced by arahants, but they never generate <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>. Moreover, for ordinary people, not every <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> produces craving.</p>
<p id="seg-112">Some Western Buddhists have proposed that the “forward” order of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> can be halted by “cutting” the process between <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> and <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>. Often I have heard some suggest that rebirth can be avoided through using <span lang="pi">sati</span> (mindfulness) on <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> to stop it generating <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span> and the following factors of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>. This is, in my understanding, misconceived on two grounds.</p>
<p id="seg-113">First, the “forward” order of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> was never intended to demonstrate how the process should be “cut”. The “forward” order is only meant to show how the process continues. The teaching on how the process is “cut”, or rather ceases, is the purpose reserved for the “reverse” order of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> or “dependent cessation”.</p>
<p id="seg-114">Secondly, even though <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> does not inevitably produce <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>, because it is not a sufficient condition, it is well stated by the Buddha that only when <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> ceases once and for all does <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> never generate <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>! This means that one doesn’t “cut” the process using <span lang="pi">sati</span> on <span lang="pi">vedanā</span>. <span lang="pi">Sati</span> is not enough. The process stops from the cessation of <span lang="pi">avijjā</span>, as dependent cessation makes abundantly clear. The cessation of <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> is much more than the practice of <span lang="pi">sati</span>.</p>
<h1 id="seg-115"><span class="chapnum"> 4</span><br>Misreading the Suttas</h1>
<p id="seg-116">There is a sutta in the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:an" class="sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span> that is often presented as evidence that dependent origination does not span more than one life. This sutta is called “Tenets” in the Pali Text Society’s translation (AN 3.61). Some interpret this sutta as stating that <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> is not caused by <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations (<span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span>) done in a past life. Therefore the link called <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> in dependent origination (which does cause <span lang="pi">vedanā</span>) cannot mean <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations of a previous life. I will show below that this conclusion is wrong, as it comes from a misreading of the suttas.</p>
<p id="seg-117">The relevant part of this sutta presents three theories to explain why one feels pleasant, unpleasant or neutral <span lang="pi">vedanā</span>. The first theory states that everything one feels is due to what one did in the past (<span lang="pi">sabbaṁ taṁ pubbe ka&shy;ta&shy;he&shy;tu</span>). The other two theories state that everything one feels is either caused by God or by chance. The Buddha categorically states in this sutta that all three theories are wrong.</p>
<p id="seg-118">The first theory, the one pertinent to this discussion, that everything that one feels now is due to what one did in the past, is repeated in the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn101" class="sesame">Devadaha Sutta</span> (<span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;101<span class='scsegments'>:2.4–2.8</span></span>) where it is said to be a belief of the Jains. The Jains held that all the suffering one experienced in this life was due to bad <span lang="pi">kamma</span> from a previous life. Indeed, this sutta clarifies this first theory as meaning everything that one feels now is due to what one did in a past life. The <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn101" class="sesame">Devadaha Sutta</span> disproves this theory.</p>
<p id="seg-119">So it is true that the Buddha denied that everything that one feels, happiness or suffering or neutral feeling, is due to what one did in a past life (i.e. due to <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations of a past life). This should be obvious. Some of what one feels is caused by <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations from a past life, some caused by past <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations earlier in this life, and some caused by <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations being performed now. What the Buddha was denying was that all happiness or suffering or neutral feelings are caused by <span lang="pi">kamma</span> from a previous life.</p>
<p id="seg-120">It should be pointed out that the Buddha is here referring to the type of feeling, rather than to feeling itself. It is true that whichever one of the three types of feeling that one experiences, happiness or suffering or neutral, is not always due to <span lang="pi">kamma</span> from a past life. But it is also true that the situation whereby one can experience feeling at all, the fact that <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> exists, is due to <span lang="pi">kamma</span> from a past life.</p>
<p id="seg-121">A simile might make this clearer. The situation that you possess a TV on a public holiday is due to you having purchased it on some previous day. Its presence, as it were, is due to <span lang="pi">kamma</span> from a past day. But whichever one of the three available channels that appears on the screen, Channel Happiness or Channel Suffering or Channel Neutral, is not always due to what you did on some previous day. The content is not all due to <span lang="pi">kamma</span> from the past.</p>
<p id="seg-122">In the same way, the Buddha states that the existence of <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> in this life is due to <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations done in the previous life. But the particular type of feeling, happiness or suffering or neutral, is not always due to <span lang="pi">kamma</span> from a previous life.</p>
<p id="seg-123">Once the distinction is made between <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> and the contents of <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> (happiness or suffering or neutral), it is clear that the Tenets Sutta doesn’t state that <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> is not caused by <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations from a previous life. It does not disprove the orthodox understanding of dependent origination as spanning three lives.</p>
<p id="seg-124">Indeed, the latter part of the Tenets Sutta introduces dependent origination from a unique starting point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-125">“Depending on the six elements (earth, air, fire, water, space and consciousness) there is the descent of the being to be born into the womb; when there is descent, there is name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>

</div>
<p id="seg-128">Thus the Buddha is clearly showing the origin of <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> as due to the descent of the being to be born into the womb. This can now be compared to the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn15" class="sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> and its definition of <span lang="pi">nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-129">“It was said ‘with consciousness as condition there is name-and-form’. How this is so, Ānanda, should be understood in this way. If consciousness were not to descend into the mother’s womb, would name-and-form take shape in the womb?”</p>
<p id="seg-130">“No, venerable sir.”</p>

</div>
<p id="seg-134">This clearly equates the descent of the being to be born into the womb of the Tenets Sutta with the descent of (rebirth linking) consciousness into the womb of the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn15" class="sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>. Thus <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> is said in the Tenets Sutta to be caused by the first consciousness arising in this life, whose own cause can only be found in a previous life.</p>
<p id="seg-135">Thus the sutta in the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:an" class="sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span> which is often presented as evidence that dependent origination does not span more than one life, when read accurately and completely, actually clearly proves the opposite. The situation that <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> exists at all is due to <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> and <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations from the previous life, and dependent origination, as taught by the Buddha, does indeed span more than a single life.</p>
<h1 id="seg-136"><span class="chapnum"> 5</span><br>The Purpose of Dependent Origination</h1>
<p id="seg-137">So far, I have described what dependent origination means. I have shown, by quoting from the original texts, that the factor <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> refers to the stream of consciousness beginning in a life after the <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> and <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations that caused the rebirth. I have shown how causality, the link between one factor and the next can involve a substantial interval of time, even extending beyond this life into a future life. In summary, I have shown that <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>, as taught by the Buddha in the suttas, can only mean a process that spans three lives. To believe that <span lang="pi">paṭicca</span> <span lang="pi">sam&shy;up&shy;pāda</span> must be restricted to a single life, or even to a few moments, is simply untenable in light of reason and facts.</p>
<p id="seg-138">It is now time to consider the purpose of dependent origination. One can gain understanding of a thing, not only by finding out what it is made of, but also by investigating what it does. Now I am going to discuss the function of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>. I will discuss three purposes of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p id="seg-139">To explain how there can be rebirth without a soul.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-140">To answer the question “What is life?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-141">To understand why there is suffering, and where suffering comes to an end.</p>
<h2 id="seg-142">5.1. Rebirth without a soul</h2></li>
</ol>
<p id="seg-143">One of the most common questions that I am asked is how can there be rebirth when there is no soul to be reborn. The answer to that question is dependent origination. <span lang="pi">Paṭiccasamuppāda</span> shows the empty process—empty of a soul, that is—which flows within a life and overflows into another life. It also shows the forces at work in the process, which drive it this way and that, even exercising sway in a subsequent life. Dependent origination also reveals the answer to how <span lang="pi">kamma</span> done in a previous life can affect a person in this life.</p>
<p id="seg-144">Dependent origination presents two sequences that generate rebirth:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p id="seg-145">Delusion (<span lang="pi">avijjā</span>) + <span lang="pi">kamma</span> → the stream of consciousness beginning at rebirth (<span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-146">Craving (<span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>) + fuel (<span lang="pi">upādāna</span>) → existence (<span lang="pi">bhava</span>) + rebirth into that existence (<span lang="pi">jāti</span>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="seg-147">These are parallel processes. They describe the same operation viewed from two different angles. I will now combine them:</p>
<p id="seg-148">Deluded <span lang="pi">kamma</span> and craving produce the fuel which generates existence and rebirth (into that existence), thereby giving rise to the start of the stream of consciousness that is at the heart of the new life.</p>
<p id="seg-149">It is <span lang="pi">kamma</span> and craving, both under the sway of delusion, that is the force propelling the stream of consciousness into a new life.</p>
<p id="seg-150">I will now offer some similes to illustrate this operation. These similes are only approximations and, therefore, will never perfectly match <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>. This is because dependent origination is mainly a process describing the flow of the mental consciousness, whilst the similes at my disposal are from the more well known material world. Still, they should help to clarify one’s understanding.</p>
<p id="seg-151">Someone goes to an airport to fly to another country. If they have enough money for the fare and they have a desire to go to a new country, then they may arrive in that land. If they have the fare but not the desire, or the desire but not the fare, or they lack both, then they will not arrive in the new country.</p>
<p id="seg-152">In this simile the person stands for the stream of consciousness; the airport stands for death; the new country stands for the next life; the fare stands for the person’s accumulated <span lang="pi">kamma</span>; and their desire to go there stands for craving. With much good <span lang="pi">kamma</span> and a craving for happiness, or just the craving to be, the stream of consciousness that one thinks of as “me” is propelled into one’s chosen next life. With much bad <span lang="pi">kamma</span> and a craving for happiness, one cannot reach the happiness one wants, and thus one is propelled into an unsatisfactory next life. With much bad <span lang="pi">kamma</span> and a craving for punishment, what we recognize in this life as the guilt complex, one falls into a next life of suffering. Then with much good <span lang="pi">kamma</span> and no craving at all, one goes nowhere. Like the traveller at the airport, they have enough money to go wherever they want first-class, but the delusion has been shattered and the desire that generated all this coming-and-going is no more. They cease at the airport.</p>
<p id="seg-153">How does one seed produce a new seed? Suppose a seed is planted in a good field, it is fed by moisture carrying essential nutrients, and it grows to maturity producing another seed at its death. There is no soul or self in the seed, yet one seed has evolved into another seed following a process of cause and effect. The original seed and the new seed are completely different. Almost certainly, there isn’t even one molecule of the original seed to be found in the new seed. Even the DNA, though similar, is not the same. It is an example of a well-known process which spans a life, but with nothing that one can identify as an essence passing unaltered from the original seed to the new seed. Rebirth, as it were, has happened with no “seed-soul” going across. I mention this example because it is similar to a metaphor of the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-154">“<span lang="pi">Kamma</span> is like the field, craving like the moisture, and the stream of consciousness like the seed. When beings are blinded by delusion and fettered with craving, the stream of consciousness becomes established, and rebirth of a new seed [consciousness] takes place in the future.”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-155">Paraphrased from <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.76</span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-156">It is interesting to describe how a recent, real instance of <span lang="pi">kamma</span> and craving worked together to change <span lang="pi">bhava</span>, the kind of one’s existence. In the late 1970’s in Britain, many uneconomical coal mines were permanently closed. One particular disused mine was close to a heavily populated area in South Wales. When some of the poor of that area had unwanted kittens, they would cheaply dispose of them by cruelly throwing them down into the abandoned mineshaft. Several years later, some engineers entered that mine to check on its safety. They found a remarkable discovery. Some of the kittens had survived the fall and, in the space of only a few generations, had evolved into a completely new species of cat, blind in their eyes but with enormous ears. Craving and behavioural conditioning (<span lang="pi">kamma</span>) had been the obvious driving forces that produced the mutation.</p>
<p id="seg-157">The above examples only begin to give an indication of the process that is <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-158">Dependent origination, after all, is mainly a process that describes the flow of mental consciousness, and this is fundamentally different from material processes. If one can imagine a beach of white sand, then the stretch looks continuous. On closer examination, though, one finds that the beach is made up of an uncountable number of small grains, each close to the next. If one looks even closer, one discovers that the grains aren’t even touching, that each grain is alone. Similarly, when one’s mindfulness has been empowered by jhāna meditation, one may see the stream of consciousness in much the same way. Before, it looked like a continuous stretch of unbroken cognition. But now it is revealed as granular, tiny moments of consciousness, uncountable in number, close together but not touching, and each one alone. Having seen the true nature of consciousness, only then can one see how one moment of consciousness influences what follows. <span lang="pi">Kamma</span>, like a discrete particle of behavioural conditioning, together with craving combine to make the impersonal forces that steer the journey of consciousness, like an aircraft on an automatic super-pilot. Furthermore, when the insight comes, based uniquely on the data of jhāna, that the mental consciousness is independent of the body and must clearly survive the death of the body, then one sees with absolute certainty that the forces of <span lang="pi">kamma</span> and craving that drive mental consciousness now, will continue to drive the mind through and beyond death. Rebirth and its process are seen. <span lang="pi">Paṭiccasamuppāda</span> is understood.</p>
<p id="seg-159">The Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda at the opening of the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn15" class="sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span> (<span class="sclinktext">DN&#8239;15</span>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-160">“This dependent origination, Ānanda, is deep and it appears deep.”</p>

</div>
<p id="seg-162">In my opinion, one needs the experience of jhāna to see it clearly. Nevertheless, I hope that the explanation and similes that I have given will help throw some light onto the true nature and purpose of this impersonal process that drives the mind from life to life. At least you can know that when <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> is fully understood, it is also clearly seen how rebirth happens without any soul.</p>
<h2 id="seg-163">5.2. What is life?</h2>
<p id="seg-164">One of the major difficulties that Buddhists find with the teaching of anattā is that if there is no soul or self, then what is this? What is it that thinks, wills, feels or knows? What is it that is reading this? In summary, what is life?</p>
<p id="seg-165">In one of the most profound of all suttas in the Buddhist scriptures, the Kaccānagotta Sutta (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.15</span>), which was to play a major role in later Buddhist history, the Buddha stated that, for the most part, people’s views on the nature of life fall into one of two extremes. Either they maintain that there is a soul, or they hold that there is nothing at all. Unfortunately, too many Buddhists confuse the teaching of anattā and side with the view that there is nothing at all.</p>
<p id="seg-166">The Buddha condemned both extremes with a devastating argument based on experience. It is untenable to maintain that there is a soul because anything that can be meaningfully considered as a soul or self—the body, will, love, consciousness or mind—can all be seen as impermanent. As the Buddha put it “One cannot say that there is (a soul), because a cessation (of all that can be a soul) is seen”. On the other hand, it is untenable to maintain that there is nothing at all, because it is obvious that life is! As the Buddha put it “One cannot say that there is nothing, because an arising (of all phenomena) is seen”. Thus, as the Buddhist philosopher-monk Nāgārjuna (2nd century CE) was to remind everyone, the Buddha clearly denied the doctrine of absolute emptiness.</p>
<p id="seg-167">Even today, most people fall into one of these two extremes. Either that there is nothing at all and the mind, love, life is complete illusion, or that there is an eternal soul with God as the corollary. Both are wrong.</p>
<p id="seg-168">The Kaccānagotta Sutta continues with the Buddha pointing out that there is a middle that has been excluded in this dichotomy of views. There is a third option that avoids both extremes. So what is this “middle” between the extremes of a soul and nothingness? That middle, said the Buddha, is <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-169">When the Buddha stated that it is untenable to hold that there is a soul or self (or a God) because a cessation is seen, he explained what he meant as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-170">“From the cessation of delusion, <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations cease; from the cessation of <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations consciousness ceases … from the cessation of birth, <span lang="pi">dukkha</span> ceases.”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-171"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.15<span class='scsegments'>:3.7–3.9</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-172">He was referring to the passing away process called dependent cessation. This impersonal process is the very thing that we identify as life. Moreover, it includes all the “usual suspects” that masquerade as a soul: the body (part of <span lang="pi">nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span>), will (part of the <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations, sometimes <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>), love (part of the <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations and mostly part of <span lang="pi">upādāna</span>, clinging), consciousness (<span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span>) and mind (part of <span lang="pi">saḷ&shy;āya&shy;ta&shy;na</span> and often equivalent to <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span>). These usual suspects are clearly seen in the light of dependent cessation as transient, insubstantial, granular and fading away soon after they arise. They are all conditioned. They exist only as long as they are supported by their external causes, which are themselves unstable. When the external supporting causes disappear, so do each of the usual suspects. Because these things do not persist, since they do not continue in being, it is untenable to hold that there is a soul, a self or a God.</p>
<p id="seg-173">When the Buddha stated that it is also untenable to maintain that all is pure emptiness, void, nothing, because an arising is seen, he explained what he meant as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-174">“From the arising of delusion, <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations arise, from <span lang="pi">kamma</span> formations arises the stream of consciousness in the next life … from birth arises <span lang="pi">dukkha</span>!”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-175"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.15<span class='scsegments'>:3.4–3.6</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-176">He was referring to the arising process called dependent origination. Again, this impersonal process includes all that we can know as “life”. Because this arising is seen, one cannot say they are not. It is not an illusion. These phenomena are real.</p>
<p id="seg-177">A simile might help here. In mathematics a point is a concept drawn from the science of life. It describes aspects of real phenomena. Yet a point has no size. It is smaller than any measure that you can suggest, yet it is bigger than nothing. In a sense, one cannot say a point is, because it does not persist, it does not continue in space. Yet one cannot say it is not, as it is clearly different from nothing. The point is similar to the momentary nature of conscious experience. Nothing continues in being therefore it cannot be something. Something arises therefore it cannot be nothing. The solution to this paradox, the excluded middle, is the impersonal process.</p>
<p id="seg-178">In <span data-sesame-key="wp:Advaita_Vedanta" class="sesame">Advaita Vedanta</span>, one common method is to pursue the enquiry “Who am I?” That is a loaded question. It carries an implicit premise that has yet to be agreed on. The question “Who am I?” assumes that “I am”, only one doesn’t know what. In the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn2" class="sesame">Sabbāsava Sutta</span> (<span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;2<span class='scsegments'>:7.2–7.6</span></span>) the Buddha called such enquiries “attending unwisely” (<span lang="pi">ayoniso mana&shy;sik&shy;āra</span>), and in the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn38" class="sesame">Mahātaṇhāsankhaya Sutta</span> (<span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;38<span class='scsegments'>:24.1–24.2</span></span>) the Buddha described this as remaining “inwardly perplexed” (<span lang="pi">ka&shy;thaṁ&shy;ka&shy;thā</span>). In other words, it doesn’t lead to anything penetrating. This enquiry of Advaita Vedanta is said to end with an experience of ultimate reality described as “You are that”, or tat tvam asi in Sanskrit. But such an end-doctrine is plainly begging the question. What is this “That” that you are? The Buddha never circled around the issue in such a fruitless way. For The Buddha would say:</p>
<div class="line-block-center">
<p id="seg-179"><span lang="pi">Paṭiccasamuppādo tvaṁ asi</span>.<br>
        “You are dependent origination.”</p>
</div>
<p id="seg-180">What was once assumed to be “me”, a self or a soul, or assumed to be an illusion or complete emptiness, is now clearly seen as the impersonal process of dependent origination, a causal sequence rolling on from life to life, containing all and anything that can meaningfully be a soul, the “usual suspects” as I call them, but nothing continuing in being.</p>
<p id="seg-181">So, if you wanted to find out who you are, now you have the answer: dependent origination! And if you wanted to find out what is life, now you also have the answer: dependent origination!</p>
<p id="seg-182"><span lang="pi">Paṭiccasamuppāda</span>—that’s life!</p>
<h2 id="seg-183">5.3. Why suffering?</h2>
<p id="seg-184">The main purpose of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> is to establish the reason why we suffer, and to find a way of eliminating suffering once and for all. To understand this point, we must now take a look at the Buddha’s discovery of dependent origination in the context of the story of the Buddha’s life.</p>
<p id="seg-185">The Bodhisatta (an unenlightened being soon to become Enlightened) sat under the Bodhi Tree on the night of his enlightenment for the sole purpose of finding a solution to suffering. As a young man, he had been deeply moved by the tragic sights of an old man, a sick man, and a dead man. Realizing that the suffering of old age, sickness and death was the certain destiny of himself as well, he left home in order to find a way out of all suffering. Under the Bodhi Tree, the Bodhisatta entered the jhānas for the first time since he was a small boy. Having thus empowered his mind, he then pursued a method of enquiry called <span lang="pi">yoniso mana&shy;sik&shy;āra</span>, which literally means “work of the mind which goes back to the source”. The problem was suffering, in particular the seemingly inescapable suffering associated with old age, sickness and death. Tracing the problem back to the source, the source was seen as birth.</p>
<div class="line-block-center">
<p id="seg-186"><span lang="pi">Jāti</span>-<span lang="pi">paccayā</span> <span lang="pi">dukkha</span>,<br>
       “Suffering is caused by birth.”</p>
</div>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<p id="seg-187">As shown above, birth is a sufficient cause for suffering, that is, birth must give rise to <span lang="pi">dukkha</span>. Every being that is born will get old, get sick and die, and experience the inescapable <span lang="pi">dukkha</span> associated with that process. Thus birth is the problem.</p>
<p id="seg-188">This first link of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> is rarely given the attention it deserves. It has enormous implications. Before the great insight into dependent origination under the Bodhi Tree, the Bodhisatta, like most people, had lived in hope that somehow he could attain perfect happiness in this existence or some future existence. Now he saw that all existence (<span lang="pi">bhava</span>) is inextricably involved with suffering. There is no perfect happiness to be found in any form of existence. As the Buddha said in the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:an" class="sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-189">“Just as a tiny bit of faeces has a bad smell, so I do not recommend even a tiny bit of existence, not even for so long as a finger-snap.”</p>

<p id="seg-191">A simile might help. A person born in a harsh prison, raised in that prison, who has spent all their time in the prison, can only know prison life. They don’t even suspect that anything beyond their prison can exist. So they make the best of prison. Those who think positively, because they have gone to prison seminars, begin to think that the harsh prison is instead a wonderful place. They even compose songs like “All jails bright and beautiful … the good Lord made them all!” Others get involved with social service, compassionately decorating the prison cells of others. When someone gets tortured or otherwise punished in jail, they think something has gone wrong and look for someone to blame. If someone suggests that it is the very nature of jail to be suffering, then they are dismissed as a pessimist and told to “Get a life!” One full moon night, a prisoner discovers a door leading out of the jail and goes through. Only then does he realize that jail was inherently suffering and you can’t make it otherwise. He goes back to tell his fellow prisoners. Most don’t believe him. They can’t even imagine anything other than their jail. When he says that the jail is suffering and the cessation of imprisonment is happiness, he is accused by one and all of escapism.</p>
<p id="seg-192">Sometimes people rebuke me, saying, “You monks are just trying to escape from the real world!” I reply “Well done! At last someone else has understood Buddhism!” What’s wrong with escapism, especially when one realises that the real world is the harsh prison.</p>
<p id="seg-193">The enlightenment experience of the Buddha began with the experience of jhānas. These “stages of letting go” are also stages of increasing bliss. After jhāna, one can reflect on the reason why these jhānas are by far the most pure and powerful happiness of one’s life. What is the cause of such happiness? Ajahn Chah used to say that it is like having had a tight rope around one’s neck for as long as one can remember. Then one day the rope is suddenly released. The bliss and ease that is felt is because a huge burden of suffering has gone. The ecstasy of jhāna is because one has escaped, albeit temporarily, from what people mean by “the real world”. When the Buddha reflected on jhāna, he realized that the real world is suffering, it is a jail, and release from it is bliss. He could only know this once he had stepped out beyond jail. That is one of the purposes of jhāna. Jhāna is also called <span lang="pi">vi&shy;mok&shy;kha</span>, which means “release”.</p>
<p id="seg-194">Even arahants, enlightened monks and nuns, experience suffering. They are not released from suffering, they are still in the world, in jail. The main difference between an ordinary “prisoner” and an arahant is that the latter is certain to leave soon. Using the simile from the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:thag" class="sesame">Theragātha</span> (<span class="sclinktext">Thag&#8239;17.2<span class='scsegments'>:23.1–23.4</span></span>), an arahant is like a workman having completed the job and now calmly waiting for his wages. In the sutta called “<span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn36.6" class="sesame">The Dart</span>” suffering is compared to being stabbed with two darts. An arahant is only stabbed with one dart. The two “darts” refer to bodily suffering and mental suffering. The arahant, alone of this world, only experiences bodily suffering. But it is still enough to say that an arahant in this life still experiences suffering. As the enlightened nun Vajirā explained (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;5.10<span class='scsegments'>:6.1–6.4</span></span>), what it feels like to be an arahant is just experiencing suffering arising and suffering passing away, and this was confirmed by the Buddha in the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12.15" class="sesame">Kaccānagotta Sutta</span> (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.15<span class='scsegments'>:2.6</span></span>), already mentioned above. Arahants experience suffering because all existence (<span lang="pi">bhava</span>) or birth (<span lang="pi">jāti</span>) is suffering. Only when they pass away, or <span lang="pi">pari&shy;nib&shy;bāna</span>, when existence ceases, does suffering end once and for all.</p>
<div class="line-block-center">
<p id="seg-195"><span lang="pi">Bhavanirodho nib&shy;bān&shy;aṁ</span><br>

<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-196"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.68<span class='scsegments'>:5.2, 5.4, 12.2, 12.4, 13.2, 13.6</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-197">Having discovered that existence (<span lang="pi">bhava</span>) and birth (<span lang="pi">jāti</span>) are a sufficient cause of suffering (<span lang="pi">dukkha</span>), that they must create suffering, the problem became how to put an end to more existence (<span lang="pi">pun&shy;a&shy;bha&shy;va</span>) and rebirth. As it became popularly and accurately known, the goal of Buddhist practice (for those who realize that the real world’s a jail and are not in denial of this truth) is to make an end of samsara, the incredibly long journey through countless lives, and get off the crushing wheel of rebirth.</p>
<p id="seg-198">Thus, the Bodhisatta continued to pursue <span lang="pi">yoniso mana&shy;sik&shy;āra</span>, “the work of the mind that goes back to the source”, to find the causes of <span lang="pi">bhava</span> and <span lang="pi">jāti</span>. He traced the sequence of causes, now known as dependent origination, through craving (<span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>) back to delusion (<span lang="pi">avijjā</span>). It was delusion that was seen as the basic culprit.</p>
<p id="seg-199">What is this delusion? <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> is consistently explained as not fully understanding the four noble truths. In other word, one doesn’t realize that one is in jail. It is amazing how so many people are in such profound denial of life’s suffering that they show severe signs of maladjustment to old age, sickness and death. Some people are even surprised that these things even happen, and exhibit such derangements as anger and grief when they do! Our delusion is that life can be fixed.</p>
<p id="seg-200">As every Buddhist would know, the way to get out of jail, to put an end to rebirth and the inevitable suffering that follows, is to develop the noble eightfold path culminating in jhāna (<span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;samā&shy;dhi</span>). But that is a subject for another essay.</p>
<p id="seg-201">Here I want to add that dependent origination is often cited as an alternative definition of the second noble truth, the cause of suffering. And dependent cessation is an alternative definition of the third noble truth, the cessation of suffering. (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.43</span>) Thus the main purpose of dependent origination, equivalent to the Second Noble Truth, is to answer the question “Why suffering?” And the main purpose of dependent cessation, equivalent to the third noble truth, is to answer the question “How can suffering be stopped?”</p>
<h1 id="seg-202">Conclusion</h1>
<p id="seg-203">In this essay, I have attempted to describe what <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> is all about. I began by presenting the standard sequence of the twelve factors, and then their meaning as defined by the Buddha himself. It should have been clear from these definitions that <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>, as the Buddha meant it to be understood, spans more than one life.</p>
<p id="seg-204">I then went on to discuss a Western model of causality, the necessary and sufficient conditions, and how these slotted so neatly into <span lang="pi">idap&shy;pac&shy;cay&shy;atā</span>, the Buddha’s model of causality. I later used the “necessary and sufficient conditions” model to throw more light on the different forms of causal relationships between each pair of factors.</p>
<p id="seg-205">A digression on the meaning of <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālika</span>, and a section called “Misreading the Suttas”, were meant to address some objections (misconceived, as I hope that I have proved) to the fact that <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> in the suttas does span more than one life. Although the argument here was somewhat technical, it highlighted the importance of <span lang="pi">kamma</span> and rebirth to the Buddha’s Dhamma. <span lang="pi">Kamma</span> and rebirth are obviously not a mere cultural accretion, as some modern misinformed authors would have us believe, but are essential to the central teaching of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-206">Lastly, I introduced a section rarely mentioned in essays about <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>: what is its purpose? I have shown that the purpose of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> is much more than mere food for intellectual debate. Indeed, <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> demonstrates how there can be rebirth without a soul, it reveals what life is, and it explains why there is suffering together with the way suffering is totally ended. <span lang="pi">Paṭiccasamuppāda</span> answers the big questions.</p>
<p id="seg-207">It is no exaggeration to state that <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> is at the very heart of the Dhamma. As the Buddha stated, one who understands <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> accurately, also sees the Dhamma. And the one who sees the Dhamma fully, is one who has entered the stream and will soon put an end to all suffering. May that be you!</p>

<h2 id="seg-209">Some Remarks on Dependent Origination</h2>
<p id="seg-210">The following is from a letter by Ajahn Brahm written in May 1994 (some 8 years before the main text). It is entitled “Some Remarks on Dependent Origination” and covers much of the same ground as the main text. It is presented here, reformatted to aid understanding, together with some reference clarifications.</p>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:1em'>
<h3 id="seg-211">The Meaning of the Terms in Paṭiccasamuppāda</h3>
<p id="seg-212">The <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> is explained in detail at two places in the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:sutta" class="sesame">Sutta Piṭaka</span>: in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn15" class="sesame">Mahānidāna Sutta</span>, No 15 of the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:dn" class="sesame">Digha Nikāya</span>; and in the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12" class="sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>, Saṁyutta No XII of the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:sn" class="sesame">Saṁyutta Nikāya</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-213">The <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12" class="sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span> begins with a simple expression of the 12 links in forward and reverse order (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.1</span>). The following Sutta, <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12.2" class="sesame">Vibhaṅga</span>, No 2 of the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12" class="sesame">Nidāna Saṁyutta</span>, explains the meaning of each of the 12 terms.</p>
<p id="seg-214">I recommend that you read this Sutta carefully so that you will see for yourself what the Buddha meant by each term. In particular, you will see that <span lang="pi">jāti</span> can only mean birth, the sort of birth which for a human occurs in a mother’s womb.</p>

</ol>
<p id="seg-235">Elsewhere, perhaps, <span lang="pi">jāti</span> may mean different things, but here, in the Sutta defining the meanings of the terms in the <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>, <span lang="pi">jāti</span> unmistakeably means the appearance of a being in a particular class of beings, or “birth” as is generally understood for a human being.</p>
<p id="seg-236">The meaning of <span lang="pi">bhava</span> can be found at <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.76</span>. Look this up in Pali and you will relish its deeper meaning.</p>
<p id="seg-237">The meaning of <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> can not readily be discerned from <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.2</span>, but if you look at <span class="sclinktext">DN&#8239;15</span>, you will find the following at verse 21:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-238">“It was said: ‘With consciousness as condition there is mentality-materiality’. How that is so, Ānanda, should be understood in this way. If consciousness (<span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span>) were not to descend into the mother’s womb, would mentality-materiality (<span lang="pi">nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span>) take shape in the womb?”’</p>
<p id="seg-239">“Certainly not venerable Sir”</p>

<span class="sclinktext">DN&#8239;15<span class='scsegments'>:21.1–21.5</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-241">So, the way the Buddha said <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span>, in the context of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>, should be understood is clearly as the <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> which descends into a mother’s womb at conception, what the Commentaries call Rebirth-Linking-Consciousness.</p>
<p id="seg-242">The meaning of <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> as something which produces rebirth can easily be discerned in the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn120" class="sesame">Saṅkhārupapatti Sutta</span>, (<span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;120</span>). <span lang="pi">Uppatti</span> is usually translated as rebirth and if you look at the context this meaning is obvious. A typical passage in this Sutta is analysed in <span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Johansson 1981a">Johansson 1973</span>. I recommend that you find this book, look up the passage on pages 66 and 67 and see how the word <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> is used in the meaning of a willed activity of body, speech or mind which causes rebirth.</p>

<p id="seg-244">It is essential to know precisely what the Buddha meant when he used each of the 12 terms in the <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>. There is no need to go to the Commentary to find these meanings. They are clearly evident in the Suttas themselves, as I hope I have indicated. Only when one accurately understands the meaning of each of the 12 links is there a hope that one will understand the profundity of the whole <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> as the Buddha meant it to be understood.</p>
<h3 id="seg-245">The Fallacy of The “One Life” Interpretation Of Paṭiccasamuppāda</h3>
<p id="seg-246">Once one sees what the Buddha meant by <span lang="pi">jāti</span> in the context of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> (see <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.2</span> and <span class="sclinktext">DN&#8239;15<span class='scsegments'>:4.1–4.5</span></span>) then wriggle as one might, one will have to accept that the Buddha meant <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> to span more than one life. What becomes before <span lang="pi">jāti</span>, eg <span lang="pi">bhava</span>, <span lang="pi">upādāna</span>, <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>…, must refer to something occurring before birth (a cause is simultaneous with, or more often precedes, its effect), ie in what is called a previous existence. To maintain otherwise is merely to ignore the facts and throw away all reason.</p>
<p id="seg-247">Having seen the process that is described by <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> moving from one life to another around <span lang="pi">jāti</span>, having broken the fixation on a wrong idea, it is easy to accept the meaning of <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> as the first consciousness which arises in the new life as implied by <span class="sclinktext">DN&#8239;15<span class='scsegments'>:21.2</span></span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-248">“If consciousness were not to descend into the mother’s womb, would mentality-materiality (<span lang="pi">nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span>) take shape in the womb?”</p>

</div>
<p id="seg-250">That <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> as the starting point of a new life is the meaning in the context of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> is also made clear at <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.61<span class='scsegments'>:13.4–13.5</span></span>:</p>
<blockquote>

<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-252">“Monks, based on the 6 elements, there is descent into the womb. This descent taking place, name and shape come to pass. Conditioned by name-and-shape is the six-fold sphere (of sense). Conditioned by the six-fold sphere is contact. Conditioned by contact is feeling”</p>

<p id="seg-255">Lastly, it becomes obvious that the full <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> cannot be interpreted as existing in one life when one looks at the first 3 links in reverse order: When <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> ceases so does <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> and, consequently, so does <span lang="pi">viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span>. In other words the ending of <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> causes the ending of <span lang="pi">viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span>. Now what type of <span lang="pi">viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span> can possibly cease as a result of a person eradicating <span lang="pi">avijjā</span>, the ignorance of the full meaning of the Four Noble Truths? We all know that an Arahat, one who has eradicated <span lang="pi">avijjā</span>, remains fully conscious, retaining <span lang="pi">viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span>, after his attainment. He does not become unconscious at the moment of his attainment, ever more to be comatose until he dies! So <span lang="pi">viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span> cannot mean the ordinary, arising in every moment, type of consciousness. However, we all know that sometime after the attainment of Arahant, after a period of days or years after <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> is ended, the Arahant’s life span ends, the 5 <span lang="pi">khan&shy;dhas</span> dissolve and they never arise again. In particular, the 5th <span lang="pi">khandha</span>, the binding <span lang="pi">viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span>, ceases after the life span of an Arahant ends. Thus, it is very clear that the <span lang="pi">viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span> which is caused to cease by the ending of <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> is the first arising of consciousness in a new life, or in other words the rebirth linking consciousness of the Commentary. Nothing else makes sense. No advocate of the “one-life” interpretation of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> has ever been able to explain how <span lang="pi">viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span> can be something existing in this life and yet ceases in this life for an Arahant!</p>
<h3 id="seg-256">The Meaning of the Paṭiccasamuppāda According to the Buddha</h3>
<p id="seg-257">It becomes quite clear that <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> explains the process of rebirth. It gives the answer to the often asked question. “How can there be rebirth when there is no-self?” In explaining the process of rebirth it uncovers the causes of rebirth. So, one can eliminate rebirth by eliminating the causes. Remember that the point of this exercise is to stop being reborn, to get off the “wheel of rebirth”, <span lang="pi">saṁsāra</span>, or as Ven. Sariputta once answered to a Brahmin who asked what is the true difference between <span lang="pi">sukha</span> and <span lang="pi">dukkha</span>:</p>
<div class="line-block-center"><p class="OAstart" id="seg-258">“To be reborn (<span lang="pi">ab&shy;hi&shy;nib&shy;bat&shy;ti</span>) friend is <span lang="pi">dukkha</span>.<br>        Not to be reborn is <span lang="pi">sukha</span>?”.</p></div>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-259"><span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;10.65<span class='scsegments'>:2.2</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-260">The <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> explains the process of rebirth in 2 ways starting at 2 causes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p id="seg-261"><span lang="pi">avijjā</span> → <span lang="pi">Saṅk&shy;hāra</span> → birth → <span lang="pi">viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span> → <span lang="pi">nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;paṁ</span> → <span lang="pi">saḷ&shy;āya&shy;ta&shy;na</span> → <span lang="pi">phassa</span> → <span lang="pi">vedanā</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-262"><span lang="pi">taṇhā</span> → <span lang="pi">upādāna</span> → <span lang="pi">bhava</span> → birth → <span lang="pi">jāti</span> → <span lang="pi">jarā maraṇaṁ soka pari&shy;deva dukkha dom&shy;an&shy;as&shy;sa upāyāsa</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="seg-263">The cause of <span lang="pi">dukkha</span>, and rebirth, can be said to be <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> or can be said to be <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>. When one stops the other stops immediately. Thus it gives two ways of explaining the process of rebirth, first through willed actions (<span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span>) of body speech and mind originated through <span lang="pi">avijjā</span>, and second through <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span> giving rise to clinging (<span lang="pi">upādāna</span>) giving rise to existence (Bhava - see the explanation of <span lang="pi">bhava</span> at <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.76</span>) producing rebirth (<span lang="pi">jāti</span>). The first sequence can be seen in the Suttas at <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.61<span class='scsegments'>:15.2–15.7</span></span>. The second sequence can be found in <span class="sclinktext">DN&#8239;15<span class='scsegments'>:2.1–2.8, 3.1–3.2</span></span>.</p>
<h3 id="seg-264">The Arguments Given Against Paṭiccasamuppāda Describing Rebirth</h3>
<p id="seg-265"><strong>1:</strong> <em>“Words have different meanings in different contexts and so, for example, can’t <span lang="pi">jāti</span> mean a metaphorical birth?”</em></p>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<p id="seg-266">However the Incomparable Teacher, the Buddha, foresaw possible confusion by giving precise definitions of the terms he used when he used them. Thus at the beginning of <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.2</span>, the Buddha explained methodically the meaning of each term. Even in <span class="sclinktext">DN&#8239;15</span> he made certain that no uncertainty as to meanings could remain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-267">“How that is so, Ananda, should be understood in this way. If there were absolutely and utterly no birth of any kind anywhere—that is, of gods into the state of gods, of celestials into the state of celestials, of spirits, demons, human beings, quadrupeds, winged creatures, and reptiles, each into their own state—if there were no birth of beings of any sort into any state…”</p>

<p id="seg-268">—<span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Bodhi 1984a">Bodhi 1984</span>, page 54.</p>
</div>
<p id="seg-269">How more clear can one make it?! If one actually looks at <span class="sclinktext">DN&#8239;15</span>, or at <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.2</span>, the meaning ascribed to these words in the context of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> by the Buddha become obvious. In particular, <span lang="pi">Jāti</span> is clearly not intended to be used metaphorically. It is meant by the Buddha to refer to the beginning of life in the various classes of existence, the birth of a living being.</p>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<p id="seg-270"><strong>2:</strong> <em>“All dhammas, at least useful ones anyway, are supposed to be</em> <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ko</span> <em>and</em> <span lang="pi">akāliko</span><em>. How does this apply to the</em> <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> <em>if it spans more than one life?”</em></p>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<p id="seg-271">I am confident that no-one will argue that <span lang="pi">mar&shy;aṇ&shy;as&shy;sa&shy;ti</span> is a useful Dhamma, and yet <span lang="pi">mar&shy;aṇ&shy;as&shy;sa&shy;ti</span> is described by the Buddha as contemplation of one’s physical death, which is something which has not happened yet! The same can be said of recollection of one’s past liberality. <span lang="pi">Cāgā&shy;nus&shy;sati</span>, one of the 40 <span lang="pi">kam&shy;maṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span>, it is something which happened in the past. How can these be <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ko</span> and <span lang="pi">akāliko</span>?</p>
<p id="seg-272">The point is that <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ko</span> does not mean, cannot mean, something existing in the present moment experienced in the present moment! It means something which can be understood in the present moment. Understanding (<span lang="pi">paññā</span>) is different to experience (<span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span>), see the beginning of the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn43" class="sesame">Mahāvedalla Sutta</span> (<span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;43<span class='scsegments'>:3.1–6.5</span></span>). One can understand each step, each link, of the <span lang="pi">Paṭicca</span> <span lang="pi">Sam&shy;up&shy;pāda</span> here and now. Old age (<span lang="pi">jarā</span>) and death (<span lang="pi">maraṇaṁ</span>) one can see in others, just as the Bodhisatta Gotama saw them as two of the “Devadūta”. They are <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālikā</span> Dhamma even though one may not be personally experiencing them now! They can be clearly understood without doubt, for oneself, here and now, that is what makes them <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālikā</span>. Similarly one can understand <span lang="pi">jāti</span>, the birth of a human being here and now.</p>
<p id="seg-273">Personally, I have never witnessed a human birth but I have not the slightest doubt that we all come into this present life through the same way, by birth! The possibility of full understanding (<span lang="pi">paññā</span>) here and now in regard to birth, <span lang="pi">jāti</span>, makes it a <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālikā</span> Dhamma. <span lang="pi">Bhava</span> can be understood here and now and, if one has a very clear mind, can be experienced as the very same process described at AN 3.76. The same can be said of <span lang="pi">upādāna</span>, <span lang="pi">taṇhā</span>, <span lang="pi">vedanā</span>, <span lang="pi">phassa</span>, <span lang="pi">saḷ&shy;āya&shy;ta&shy;na</span> and <span lang="pi">nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;paṁ</span>. The <span lang="pi">viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span> as the first consciousness arising in a life can only be understood here and now in the same way that death (<span lang="pi">maraṇa</span>) can be understood. Thus if the death of a being, <span lang="pi">maraṇaṁ</span> qualifies as <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālikā</span> Dhamma so does the <span lang="pi">paṭi&shy;san&shy;dhi viññāṇa</span> (rebirth consciousness). <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span>, the willed <span lang="pi">kamma</span> done by body speech and mind which gives rise to rebirth can be experienced as well as understood here and now. In fact, the only link of the <span lang="pi">Paṭicca</span> <span lang="pi">Sam&shy;up&shy;pāda</span> which, strictly speaking, can never be experienced even when it is happening but it can be understood is <span lang="pi">avijjā</span>. Only the Arahant properly understands <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> and by then it is no more. Of course, no one would argue that <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> is not part of the Buddha’s Teaching because it can not be experienced! All agree that even <span lang="pi">avijjā</span> is <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālikā</span> Dhamma, because it can be understood here and now!</p>
<p id="seg-274">The causal relationship between the 12 links can be harder to understand. Indeed, only the <span lang="pi">so&shy;tā&shy;pan&shy;na</span> and higher <span lang="pi">ariyas</span> will fully understand these causal relationships. It must be borne in mind that in such causal relationships, the cause may precede the effect by a lengthy interval. For example, in the causal relationship between birth (<span lang="pi">jāti</span>) and <span lang="pi">maraṇaṁ</span> (death); the cause, birth, may precede the effect, death, by 100 or more years. A cause which produces an effect after an interval of time is called <span lang="pi">pu&shy;re&shy;jā&shy;ta&shy;pac&shy;ca&shy;yo</span>, pre-nascence condition, the 10th of the 24 <span lang="pi">Paccaya</span> which we chant at funerals. Because the cause may have ceased before the effect arises, much of causality can not be experienced “in the moment”. Instead, causal relations are discerned using <span lang="pi">yoniso</span> <span lang="pi">mana&shy;sik&shy;ārā</span>, the work of the mind which goes back to the source (Yoni). Indeed, <span lang="pi">yoniso mana&shy;sik&shy;ārā</span> is the main cause for the arising <span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi</span> (e.g. at <span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;43</span>) and <span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi</span> includes understanding <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> (e.g. at <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;10.92</span>). Thus <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> is understood, here and now, by applying <span lang="pi">yoniso mana&shy;sik&shy;ārā</span>. It is in this way that the causal relations between the 12 links become discerned by <span lang="pi">paññā</span> and, having been understood here and now, become <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālikā</span> Dhamma.</p>
<p id="seg-275">It is misleading of anyone to claim that one needs <span lang="pi">pub&shy;ben&shy;ivā&shy;sān&shy;us&shy;sati</span>, memory of previous lives, to be able to understand the process of rebirth described in the <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>! One understands <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> using <span lang="pi">yoniso mana&shy;sik&shy;ārā</span> in the way described above. And, whatever can be understood here and now becomes <span lang="pi">san&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi&shy;ka</span> and <span lang="pi">akālikā</span> Dhamma.</p>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<p id="seg-276"><strong>3:</strong> <em>“A Sutta in the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:an" class="sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span> has been understood by some to imply that “<span lang="pi">vedanā</span> is not always the karmic result of a previous life” and therefore none of the links in the</em> <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> <em>can refer to a previous life.”</em></p>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<p id="seg-277">The Sutta in question is <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.61<span class='scsegments'>:2.1–3.3</span></span>. Interestingly, those who quote this part of the Sutta fail to notice <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.61<span class='scsegments'>:13.4</span></span> which I have quoted twice in this letter to support <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> being an explanation of the rebirth process!</p>
<p id="seg-278">The part of the Sutta which is relevant here is verses I-IV which three tenets are put forward and roundly rejected by the Buddha as wrong. The first is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-279">“<span lang="pi">yaṁ kiñcā purisapuggalo paṭisaṁvedeti sukhaṁ vā dukkhaṁ vā aduk&shy;kha&shy;ma sukhaṁ vā, sabbaṁ taṁ pubbe katahetū</span>”…</p>
</blockquote>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-280">“Whatsoever weal or wore or neutral feeling is experienced, all that is due to some previous action”</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-281"><span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.61<span class='scsegments'>:1.4</span></span><br>
Woodward’s translation at <span class="ptsref">PTS: A.I,173</span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-282">The other two tenets are that… all that is due to the creation of a Supreme Deity… (and) all that are un-caused and unconditioned.</p>
<p id="seg-283">It is instructive to notice that this first tenet is repeated verbatim in the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn101" class="sesame">Devadaha Sutta</span> (<span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;101<span class='scsegments'>:2.4–2.8</span></span>), where it is attributed to the Jains. In that Sutta it is clear that the tenet in full is holding that “Whatever <span lang="pi">sukha</span>, <span lang="pi">dukkha</span> or neutral feeling is experienced, all that is due to some previous action in a past life.” This is obviously wrong, as the Buddha pointed out in both Suttas, for everyone should know that some <span lang="pi">sukha</span>, some <span lang="pi">dukkha</span> and some neutral feelings that are experienced are due to some previous action in this life!</p>
<p id="seg-284">But something else needs to be pointed out about this tenet. If you look at the Pali carefully you may notice that it is referring to the types of feeling that one experiences not to the faculty of feeling (<span lang="pi">vedanā</span>) in general. It should be understood that the fact that one has <span lang="pi">vedanā</span>, the faculty of feeling, at all is due to craving and ignorance in a previous life; but the particular type of feeling, the content of <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> if you like, does not necessarily depend on <span lang="pi">kamma</span> of a previous life. Let me offer a simile. A man buys a TV, a year later he moves to a new house and there he sometimes watches channel 1, sometimes channel 2 and sometimes channel 3. The fact that in his present house he has a TV, the fact that he can experience television at all, is because of an act be performed while in his previous house, but the programme he chooses to experience are not all conditioned by some preference or other he built up while in his previous house. In this rough simile, the TV corresponds to <span lang="pi">vedanā</span>, the programme channels appearing on that TV, channels 1, 2 and 3, correspond to <span lang="pi">sukha</span>, <span lang="pi">dukkha</span> and <span lang="pi">aduk&shy;kha&shy;ma sukha</span>. Again, the fact that one has <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> of some sort is due to craving and ignorance in a previous life, but the content of that <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> or rather the particular type of feeling which is experienced is not necessarily caused by an action in a previous life. When one understands this one understands that the tenet being discussed, which originates in <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.61<span class='scsegments'>:1.4</span></span>, that is has no bearing on <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-285">But in case someone is still not convinced that <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> has a cause originating in a previous life, I cite the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12.25" class="sesame">Bhumija Sutta</span>.</p>

</div>
<p id="seg-301">The rest of the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn12.25" class="sesame">Bhumija Sutta</span> is also of interest for it indicates the role of <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> in the performance of <span lang="pi">kamma</span>. What Woodward translates as “plan those planned deeds conditioned by ignorance” is in Pali “<span lang="pi">avijjā</span> <span lang="pi">paccaya</span>. <span lang="pi">kaya</span> or <span lang="pi">vaci</span> or <span lang="pi">mano</span>—<span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;raṁ ab&shy;hi&shy;saṅk&shy;haro&shy;ti</span>…” which shows <span lang="pi">saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span> in the context of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> means “Karmic actions of body, speech or mind conditioned by ignorance”.</p>
<p id="seg-302">Thus <span lang="pi">vedanā</span> is always caused by <span lang="pi">phassa</span>. Furthermore we all know that <span lang="pi">phassa</span> is caused by <span lang="pi">nāma</span>-<span lang="pi">rūpa</span> and <span lang="pi">nāma</span>-<span lang="pi">rūpa</span> is caused by <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span>. These mind and bodily processed are caused by ignorance and craving in a previous life. Any Buddhist monk who does not agree with this, who does not accept the teaching of rebirth should look at <span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;117<span class='scsegments'>:6.1–7.3</span></span>: there are 2 forms of <span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi</span>, one for those who still have <span lang="pi">asava</span> (<span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi sāsava puñ&shy;ña&shy;bhā&shy;gi&shy;yā upadhivepakka</span>) and one for the <span lang="pi">ariya’s</span> without <span lang="pi">asava</span> (<span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi ariya anasava…</span>) The type of right view which concerns most monks is the former and it is “the view that alms and offerings are not useless, that there is fruit and result, both of good and bad actions, that there are such things as this life and the next life ...”. Thus belief in rebirth is clearly stated to be <span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi</span>, its rejection would thus be <span lang="pi">mic&shy;cha&shy;dit&shy;thi</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-303">This completes the refutation of the 3 arguments given against <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> being a description of the process of rebirth. They should be compared with the arguments against the “one-life” interpretation given in the "The Fallacy of The “One Life” Interpretation Of Paṭiccasamuppāda" section above, and held alongside the positive arguments for <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> in the other sections, as a process spanning more than one life. Then you can make your own decision based on the Suttas.</p>
<p id="seg-304">A Last Word on the Question of how to “Use” <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> In “Daily Life”</p>
<p id="seg-305">On any journey one needs a map. An accurate map. The true understanding of <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span> as describing the process of rebirth and exposing its causes is a large part of that map, if not the whole. That map is acquired at <span lang="pi">so&shy;tā&shy;pan&shy;na phala</span>. Before one has that attainment, one doesn’t really get very far at all. That is why only after the attainment of <span lang="pi">so&shy;tā&shy;pan&shy;na phala</span> until one completes one’s work is one called <span lang="pi">sekha</span> “in training”. Before <span lang="pi">so&shy;tā&shy;pan&shy;na</span>, without the map, one is neither <span lang="pi">sekha</span> nor <span lang="pi">asekha</span>. Without <span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi</span>, without the map, one wanders in circles. With the arising of <span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi</span>, when the Path becomes clear (<span lang="pi">maggo san&shy;jay&shy;ati</span> see <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;4.170</span>) One can start walking that Path, one can start training. The <span lang="pi">ariya</span> Eightfold Path is the eightfold Path walked by the <span lang="pi">ariya</span>. The <span lang="pi">put&shy;thuj&shy;jana</span> walks another Eightfold Path which is not yet deserving of the adjective <span lang="pi">ariya</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-306">So it is vitally important to obtain that map, to gain <span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi</span> of the <span lang="pi">ariya</span> kind. Suttas such as the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn43" class="sesame">Mahāvedalla Sutta</span> (<span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;43<span class='scsegments'>:13.3</span></span>) show that this sort of <span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi</span> arises due to 2 causes: <span lang="pi">yoniso mana&shy;sik&shy;ārā</span> and listening/understanding the words of another (<span lang="pi">parato ghoso</span>) (see Horner 1954, page 353) and is supported by 5 factors: <span lang="pi">sila</span>, <span lang="pi">suta</span> (equivalent to what we would call “book-knowledge), <span lang="pi">sa&shy;kac&shy;cha</span> (discussing the Dhamma), <span lang="pi">samatha</span> and <span lang="pi">vi&shy;pas&shy;sana</span>. Thus if one aspires to become a <span lang="pi">so&shy;tā&shy;pan&shy;na</span> look to either one (or both) of the 2 causes and support them with the 5 factors. That is how one should be practising in daily life.</p>
<p id="seg-307">After <span lang="pi">so&shy;tā&shy;pan&shy;na</span>, one practises according to the <span lang="pi">ariya</span> Eightfold Path which is then abundantly clear to one.</p>
<p id="seg-308">The point is, <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>, or rather its true realisation, is the heart of <span lang="pi">sam&shy;mā&shy;diṭ&shy;ṭhi</span> of the <span lang="pi">ariya</span>. It forms the foundation for further practise of the ariya, for the putthujjana, one practises in order to realise the <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>, especially by <span lang="pi">yoniso mana&shy;sik&shy;ārā</span> supported by the Five factors. The <span lang="pi">put&shy;thuj&shy;jana</span> practices aspiring to uncover the <span lang="pi">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>, not assuming he knows it!</p>
