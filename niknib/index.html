					<h2>Notes for What the Nikāyas Say and Do not Say about Nibbāna</h2>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="1">I have benefited from the kindness of Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi and Prof. Peter Harvey who both offered their careful comments and invaluable suggestions on a draft version of the present paper. Despite our disagreement on certain issues, the paper is considerably improved as a result of their generosity. My thanks are also due to a number of monks at Bodhinyana Monastery for their proofreading.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="2">I will provide references for these interpretations during the course of the paper.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="3">Most of the quotes found in this paper are taken from existing translations (see the bibliography at the end of this paper). Occasionally, where existing translations did not seem satisfactory, I have supplied my own. I have indicated all such instances. I have sometimes supplied Pali words and phrases for clarification.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="4">With the exception of most of the <em>Khuddaka-Nikāya</em>. I use the terms <em>suttas</em> and <em>Nikāyas</em> throughout this paper to refer to the four main <em>Nikāyas</em> of the Pali Canon, the <em>Vinaya-Piṭaka</em> and some of the works of the <em>Khuddaka-Nikāya</em>, specifically the <em>Udāna</em>, the <em>Itivuttaka</em>, the <em>Dhammapada</em> and the <em>Theragāthā</em>. I have also occasionally consulted parallel passages in the Chinese Buddhist Canon.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="5">See in particular <span class="sclinktext">SN 38.1:2.3–2.4</span> and <span class="sclinktext">SN 39.1-15:2.3–2.4</span>, but cf. also <span class="sclinktext">SN 43.12</span>/<span class="sclinktext">SN 43.13</span>/<span class="sclinktext">SN 43.14-43</span>, <span class="sclinktext">SN 45.6</span>, <span class="sclinktext">SN 45.36</span> and <span class="sclinktext">AN 3.53</span>/<span class="sclinktext">AN 3.54</span>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="6">This would thus include the actual event of becoming an <em>arahant</em>. As pointed out by Harvey 1995, 183, at <span class="sclinktext">SN 38.1:2.3–2.4</span> <em>arahant</em>-ship is explicitly defined as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion. This shows the close relationship between <em>Nibbāna</em> and <em>arahant</em>-ship in general. Harvey tries to show at some length that <em>Nibbāna</em> here refers to the event of attaining <em>arahant</em>-ship, not an aspect of the general state of <em>arahant</em>-ship. His first argument is that the Pali terminology points to an event rather than an ongoing reality. Without going into detail, it seems to me that the terminology is open to either interpretation, but most likely it refers to both. His second and main argument is based on the fact that <em>Nibbāna</em> is the end of <em>dukkha </em>whereas the <em>arahant</em> still has some <em>dukkha</em> remaining and thus the general state of <em>arahant</em>-ship cannot be called <em>Nibbāna</em>. But <em>Nibbāna</em> at <em>arahant</em>-ship is called <em>Nibbāna</em> ‘with residue remaining’ <span class="sclinktext">Iti 44:3.1–3.5</span>, the residue being the experience of ‘what is agreeable and disagreeable ... pleasure and pain (<em>dukkha</em>)’. It seems clear enough, therefore, that the presence of a residue of suffering does not bar the absence of lust, hatred and delusion in an <em>arahant</em> from being called <em>Nibbāna</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="7">The literal meaning of <em>Nibbāna</em> is ‘extinguishment’. (Alternatively, <em>Nibbāna</em> could perhaps be translated as ‘extinction’. However, ‘extinction’ has such negative connotations in English — connotations that obviously do not pertain to <em>Nibbāna</em> — that ‘extinguishment’ seems more appropriate). <em>Nibbāna</em> as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion is therefore simply the permanent extinguishing of these three defilements. In fact, <em>Nibbāna</em> is a relative term in the suttas, its precise connotation depending on what is being extinguished. At <span class="sclinktext">AN 9.47</span>, <span class="sclinktext">AN 9.48</span>, <span class="sclinktext">AN 9.49</span>, <span class="sclinktext">AN 9.50</span> and <span class="sclinktext">AN 9.51</span> each <em>jhāna</em> and each immaterial attainment is said to be ‘provisional <em>Nibbāna</em> (<em>nibbānaṃ ... pariyāyena</em>)’. ‘Non-provisional <em>Nibbāna</em>’ is reached at <em>arahant</em>-ship, and ‘final <em>Nibbāna</em>’ at the death of the <em>arahant</em> (see below). In each case something is extinguished (either temporarily or permanently): in first <em>jhāna</em> the five hindrances and the five senses are temporarily extinguished, in the second <em>jhāna vitakka-vicāra</em> etc.. At final <em>Nibbāna</em> all five aggregates are permanently extinguished.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="8">The <em>arahant’s</em> destruction of lust, hatred and delusion is unconditioned, since it is permanent. For this reason <em>Nibbāna</em> is also known as <em>asaṅkhata</em>, ‘not conditioned’.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="9">Note that my emphasis in this paper is not on final <em>Nibbāna</em> as the event of the death of the <em>arahant</em> but on that which happens beyond the <em>arahant’s</em> death.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="10">In fact, it seems difficult to find any unambiguous references apart from the one quoted here.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="11">That it is attainable by all <em>ariyas</em> is the commentarial interpretation. In contrast to this, a verse at <span class="sclinktext">AN 3.32</span> seems to say that this <em>samādhi</em> — the perception in this <em>samādhi</em> is given as ‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is ... <em>Nibbāna</em>’, but it seems to be equivalent to the one quoted above — is attainable only by <em>arahants</em>, i.e. one who ‘has crossed over birth and old age’, <em>atāri so jātijaran ti</em>. Whatever the correct interpretation, the broader argument remains unaffected.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="12">For instance in the <em>Paramatthadīpanī-ṭīkā: ‘evaṃ suññatādināmaṃ nibbānaṃ ārammaṇaṃ katvā pavattāni maggaphalānipi ārammaṇavasenapi suññatādināmaṁ labhati</em>’, ‘Thus having made Nibbāna, which is called “emptiness” etc., the object, the resulting path and fruit obtain the name “emptiness” etc. on account of the object’. It is noteworthy that this statement is found in a modern (19th century) commentarial work. In his translation and explanation of the <em>Abhidhammattha Saṅgaha</em>, in which he refers extensively to the above mentioned <em>ṭīkā</em>, Bodhi (1993, 363) states that: ‘the attainment of fruition (<em>phalasamāpatti</em>) is a meditative attainment by which a noble disciple enters into supramundane absorption with <em>Nibbāna</em> as object’.
						<p>It is difficult to ascertain with any precision when the idea of <em>Nibbāna</em> as an object of consciousness first appears in Pali literature. It might be claimed that it appears already in the Canonical <em>Abhidhamma</em> where the <em>asaṅkhatadhātu</em> is included in the <em>dhammāyatana</em> (<a class="extlink tipref" href="https://suttacentral.net/vb2/en/thittila?reference=main/pts&highlight=false#pts-vp-pli72">Vibh 72</a>). However, the <em>asaṅkhatadhātu</em> is then defined in exactly the same way as in the <em>suttas</em>, namely, as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion (<a class="extlink tipref" href="https://suttacentral.net/vb2/en/thittila?reference=main/pts&highlight=false#pts-vp-pli73">Vibh 73</a>). There is no indication that <em>Nibbāna</em> is an ‘existing entity’ which is taken as a direct object of consciousness. Exactly how the commentaries understand <em>Nibbāna</em> is also a moot point. I am not able to discuss this here, since it would be a major study in itself to trace the historical development of how <em>Nibbāna</em> is understood in Pali literature.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="13"><em>Nibbāna</em> cannot simply be classified as a mind object – with the corresponding consciousness being mind-consciousness – since all mind objects and their corresponding objects are said to be impermanent and suffering; see eg. <span class="sclinktext">SN 35.32</span>. Indeed, the <em>Salāyatana-Saṁyutta</em> contains a large number of suttas that directly state that mental phenomena (<em>dhammas</em>) are suffering. These statements often have an almost equational quality. And there is no clear statement anywhere in the <em>suttas</em> that there are any exceptions to this. In fact the six senses together with their six objects are called ‘the all’ (<span class="sclinktext">SN 35.23</span>), clearly indicating that there are no further senses or sense objects apart from these. These statements taken together make it impossible, to my mind, to accept the idea of <em>Nibbāna</em> as a mind object cognized by mind-consciousness. (The post-canonical literature, however, sometimes seems to take a different position, see e.g. the <em>Milindapañha</em>, <a class="extlink tipref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mil6.2.5/en/tw_rhysdavids?reference=main/pts&highlight=false">Mil 6.2.5</a>).</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="14">Deep states of <em>samādhi</em>, in particular the <em>jhānas</em>, consist of completely stable and uninterrupted perceptions, until one emerges.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="15">This interpretation hinges on understanding <em>bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ</em> to be an equational sentence: ‘the cessation of existence is <em>Nibbāna</em>’. On this reading, the expression is clearly an idea about <em>Nibbāna</em>, not a direct reference to it. If instead one were to translate this phrase as two words in apposition, ‘the cessation of existence, <em>Nibbāna</em>’, then this would be a direct reference to <em>Nibbāna</em> and one would have to conclude that the phrase concerns a direct perception of <em>Nibbāna</em>. There are other <em>suttas</em> (<span class="sclinktext">AN 3.32</span>, <span class="sclinktext">AN 10.6</span>, <span class="sclinktext">AN 11.7</span>, and <span class="sclinktext">AN 11.8</span>), however, that speak of the same sort of <em>samādhi</em> but whose interpretation is unambiguous. In these <em>suttas</em> the relevant perception is given as ‘this is peaceful, this is sublime, that is ... <em>Nibbāna</em> (et<em>aṁ santaṁ, etaṁ paṇītaṁ, yad idaṁ ... nibbānan ti</em>)’. Here the wording is such — i.e. the verb ‘to be’ is required — that there can be no doubt that we are dealing with a sentence not just words in apposition. It seems quite clear, therefore, that this concerns a perception of an idea, an idea about <em>Nibbāna</em> — i.e. ‘this is peaceful, this is sublime’ — not a direct experience of <em>Nibbāna</em>. From this it is necessary to conclude that the expression <em>bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ</em> should also be understood as a sentence, not just two words in apposition.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="16">This is equivalent to what the commentaries call <em>phalasamāpatti/phalasamāpatti-samādhi</em>; see Mp V 2, 23 and Mp V 80, 14.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="17">‘Extinguishment’ being the literal meaning of <em>Nibbāna</em> (see footnote 7 above).</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="18">See Harvey 1995, 17–19 for a short survey of such attempts, followed by a critique of them. Other than Harvey’s references, there has also been the suggestion that the <em>anattā</em> doctrine is a strategy of spiritual development that is not meant as a metaphysical position on the existence of an <em>attā</em> (Ṭhānissaro, 1993).</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="19">The translation is based on Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation of a similar passage at <span class="sclinktext">SN 12.20</span>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="20">See also Norman 1991, 207.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="21">This does not mean that one may cling to <em>Nibbāna</em>. The <em>puthujjana</em> by definition knows nothing but the five <em>khandhas</em>. Since he does not know what <em>Nibbāna</em> is he cannot possibly cling to it. (He could perhaps cling to some idea of <em>Nibbāna</em>, but such an idea would still be included within the five <em>khandhas</em>.) Once one becomes a stream-enterer, i.e. once one understands the <em>Dhamma</em>, one knows that the nature of <em>Nibbāna</em> is such that it cannot be clung to (see the last section of this paper).</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="22">There is no reason to see the denial here of ‘individual existence’ as implying the existence of a universal self or any other non-individual permanent entity.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="23">See in particular Harvey 1995, 198–214 and Johansson 1969, 111. Harvey does not in fact use the words ‘permanent consciousness’ in describing final <em>Nibbāna</em>. Instead, he says final <em>Nibbāna</em> is a ‘stopped discernment’ (Harvey 1995, 201; ‘discernment’ being Harvey’s translation of <em>viññāṇa</em>) or ‘consciousness beyond time’ (208). (He also argues that this ‘timeless’ <em>Nibbāna </em>can be periodically experienced by the <em>arahant</em> during life, 208). But the idea that <em>nirodha</em> can be understood as a ‘stopped state’ rather than just ‘cessation’ is not supported by the use of <em>nirodha</em> in the <em>Nikāyas</em>. Wherever its meaning is unambiguous it means ‘ending’, ‘cessation’; there is never any sense that it refers to a ‘state’. to make his point Harvey also employs the double meaning in English of the word ‘stopped’. For him a ‘stopped discernment’ is thus a consciousness that stands still, continuing without change, not a consciousness that has ended. In Pali, however, <em>nirodha/niruddha</em> has no such double meaning, it only means ‘stopped’ as in ‘ceased’ or ‘ended’.
					<p>As for Harvey’s use of the phrase ‘consciousness beyond time’, as opposed to ‘permanent consciousness’, it is difficult to see that it makes any difference. As a general tool of interpretation, it seems clear that the <em>Nikāyas</em> cannot possibly refute every single formulation that constitutes a contradiction to their outlook. In many cases, such as the present one, one has to make reasonable assumptions as to the implications of the <em>suttas</em>’ statements. As far as I can see, a consciousness beyond time would for all practical purposes be the same as a permanent consciousness, since it is change that gives rise to a perception of time. Moreover, since <em>Nibbāna</em> is specifically said to be <em>dhuva</em>, ‘stable’ (<span class="sclinktext">SN 43.20</span>), which in the suttas is used as a synonym for <em>nicca</em>, ‘permanent’, the idea of ‘consciousness beyond time’ as opposed to ‘permanent consciousness’ seems to be a red herring. (Editor: though, beyond the <em>Nikāyas</em>, we see that <em>Dhammasaṅgaṇī</em> 1416 and <em>Milindapaṇha</em>  <a class="extlink tipref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mil6.2.5/en/tw_rhysdavids?reference=main/pts&highlight=false">Mil 6.2.5</a> and <a class="extlink tipref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mil6.3.10/en/tw_rhysdavids?reference=main/pts&highlight=false">Mil 6.3.10</a> say that <em>Nibbāna</em> is neither past, present nor future. The meaning of this is a matter of debate.)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="24">See in particular the <em>Pañca Sutta</em> (which is identical to the <em>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</em>) at <span class="sclinktext">SN 22.59</span>. This does not mean that <em>Nibbāna</em> is a permanent self, since <em>Nibbāna</em> is not a ‘phenomenon’. See the last section of this paper for why this is so.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="25">Again, since <em>Nibbāna</em> is entirely different from consciousness (or any of the five <em>khandhas</em>), this does not mean that <em>Nibbāna</em> is not <em>anattā</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="26">Deep states of <em>samādhi</em> will be particularly attractive to grasp as a self because of their qualities of peace, stability, contentment, bliss, etc. If one has not heard or properly understood the Buddha’s teachings, it seems there will be an almost irresistible pull towards seeing these states as one’s true <em>attā</em>.
					<p>An interesting passage in this context is found at <span class="sclinktext">DN 15:27.1–32.11</span>. Here the Buddha asks the following semi-rhetorical question: ‘Where nothing at all is felt, could there be any sense of “I am” with reference to that (<em>tattha</em>)?’ (<span class="sclinktext">DN 15:30.3</span>). From the subsequent conversation it is clear that the correct answer is ‘no’ and therefore that such a ‘state’ cannot be regarded as a self.</p>
					<p>Harvey (1995, 31) seems to interpret this to mean that if there is no experience of ‘I am’ at the time one abides in a particular state, i.e. that there is no self-awareness in that state, then that is sufficient to show that that state cannot be regarded as a permanent self. If this were correct, then any deep state of <em>samādhi</em>, during which there is no perception ‘I am’, could also not be taken as a self. Yet, as I have argued above, it is perfectly possible to regard such states as an <em>attā</em> once one emerges from them.</p>
					<p>But the passage at <span class="sclinktext">DN 15:27.1–32.11</span> does not have to be interpreted as Harvey does. Its interpretation hinges on the import of the word <em>tattha</em>, which Harvey translates as ‘there’. But, as is implied in my translation above, <em>tattha</em> frequently has a ‘locative’ sense, meaning ‘in this case’, ‘about this’, ‘with reference to this’. If this is the intended meaning also in the present case, then the passage means there can be no sense of ‘I am’ <em>with reference</em> to that state. In other words, one is incapable of taking that state as a permanent self even after one emerges from it, which is precisely what one would expect of a ‘state’ where nothing at all is felt, where nothing at all is experienced.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="27">For ‘the underlying tendency to the view and conceit “I am” (<em>asmī ti diṭṭhimānānusayaṁ</em>)’, see <span class="sclinktext">MN 9</span>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="28">This statement seems to be absolute. No allowance is made for a ‘stopped’ consciousness.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="29">In other words, at the very least feeling together with some sort of perception, no matter how subtle, would be the object of consciousness. Usually the situation would be much more complex, but feeling and perception would always be present with consciousness. I will discuss passages that may seem to refer to an ‘objectless consciousness’ in the section below on ‘unestablished consciousness’ and in the last part of this paper.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="30"><em>Nibbāna</em> is specifically said to be <em>dhuva</em> at <span class="sclinktext">SN 43.20</span>, in direct contrast to how <em>viññāṇa</em> is described here. this seems to rule out any link between final <em>Nibbāna</em> and consciousness.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="31">It is hard to imagine a statement more explicit and clear than this one that a permanent consciousness does not exist. ‘There is no consciousness that is ... stable (<em>dhuva</em>)’ is again in direct contrast to the description of <em>Nibbāna</em> at SN IV 370.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="32">Again, pace Harvey, <em>nirodha</em> means ‘ceased’ in the <em>Nikāyas</em>. There is no place where it unambiguously refers to a (stopped) ‘state’.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="33">Johansson (1969, 77) suggests ‘gone to rest’ and ‘gone home’ as translations of <em>attham agamā</em>. But the only meaning in the <em>Nikāyas</em> of <em>attha-gam</em> and its cognate forms is ‘come to an end’. See in particular CPD which lists ‘disappear’, ‘cease’, ‘destroyed’, ‘gone out of existence’ and ‘annihilated’ and DP which adds ‘end’. (Though <em>attha-gam</em> is also used for the setting of the sun, the sun doesn’t ‘go home’ or ‘go to rest’; but it certainly ‘disappears’, at least temporarily. If there were any other clear cases where such metaphors were used of the sun, then perhaps ‘go home’ could be accepted as a rendering.)</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="34">This passage describes the final <em>Nibbāna</em> of the <em>arahant</em> Dabba Mallaputta.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="35">See references below.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="36">Harvey’s translation, ‘non-manifestive’, by which he means that nothing can ‘appear on or in’ this consciousness (1995, 206), in my opinion stretches the meaning of <em>anidassana</em> beyond what is reasonable. At the very least such a meaning would require a causative construction and probably something more involved (e.g. ‘the consciousness with which nothing else manifests’), not just the simple adjective. The straightforward meaning of <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> is that the consciousness itself is non-manifest.
					<p>Harvey supports his understanding by referring to a passage at MN I 127 where <em>anidassana</em>, together with <em>arūpī</em>, is used to describe space: no picture can be drawn ‘on’ space (<em>ākāsa</em>) since it is <em>anidassana</em> and <em>arūpī</em>. But one cannot deduce the exact meaning of <em>anidassana</em> simply by giving it the meaning best suited to the simile. If this were possible then <em>arūpī</em> would also mean ‘non-manifestive’ (in Harvey’s sense of the word), which it clearly does not. It also seems worth noting that this consciousness must be ‘non-manifest’ with reference to something; that is, it is a relative non-manifestation, not an absolute one. At the very least it is not non-manifest for the person who experiences it.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="37">For example in Harvey 1995, 199-201; Ñāṇamoli 2001, 1249; Johansson 1969, 76.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="38">Although the PTS version at <span class="sclinktext">DN 11:85.11–85.27</span> has the reading <em>pahaṁ</em>, I understand the correct reading here to be <em>pabhaṁ</em>. The reading <em>pahaṁ</em> seems to be unique to the Sinhalese tradition and is explained by Norman (1992: 189) as likely ‘to be an error in the Sinhalese scribal tradition, where <em>ha</em> and <em>bha</em> are very similar and easily confused’. Moreover, the reading <em>pabhaṁ</em> also seems to be the basis for the Chinese version of this sutta, which has a reading meaning ‘shining’ (T I 102c17).</div>

					<div class="booknote" data-note="40">Again, Harvey calls it a consciousness ‘beyond time’. However, as I have explained above, I cannot see how this in practice is distinguishable from a permanent consciousness. Moreover, <em>Nibbāna</em> is itself called <em>dhuva</em>, ‘permanent’. Harvey also argues that this consciousness can be attained by the <em>arahant</em> while he is still alive.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="41">Only two seemingly identical occurrences in the entire Pali Canon makes <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> a marginal concept. This in itself is a sufficient argument to set this expression aside and not allow it to affect our understanding of the relationship between <em>viññāṇa</em> and final <em>Nibbāna</em>.
					<p>Apart from its use with <em>viññāṇa</em>, <em>anidassana</em> is also found on its own, specifically at <span class="sclinktext">MN 21:14.8</span>, <span class="sclinktext">DN 33:1.10.76</span> and <span class="sclinktext">SN 43.22</span>. In the last of these three, <em>anidassana</em> is used as a description of <em>Nibbāna</em>. But this does not mean that the word <em>anidassana</em> is equivalent to <em>Nibbāna</em>. Of the altogether 32 synonyms for <em>Nibbāna</em> found at <span class="sclinktext">SN 43.12</span>, <span class="sclinktext">SN 43.13</span> & <span class="sclinktext">SN 43.14-43</span>, a large number are ordinary everyday words which are much more frequently encountered in contexts other than that of <em>Nibbāna</em>. In other words, just because <em>anidassana</em> is used as a synonym for <em>Nibbāna</em> at <span class="sclinktext">SN 43.22</span> does not in any way mean that it is not used with very different connotations elsewhere.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="42">See Warder 2001, viii and Bodhi 2000, 13. The following passage in Norman 1996, 157, commenting on the difficulty in translating Pali verse, is particularly instructive: ‘When John Brough, one of the greatest British Sanskrit scholars of this century [i.e. the 20th century], had just spent several years producing his study of the Gāndhārī Dharmapada, and had the whole of the <em>Dhammapada</em>-related literature at his fingertips, he was asked if he would produce a translation of the <em>Dhammapada</em> for the Pali text society. He replied: “I cannot. It is too difficult”’.
					<p>It is not immediately clear whether the second passage quoted above, <span class="sclinktext">MN 49:25.1</span>, is verse or prose: MLDB treats it as verse but most Pali versions of the same passage seem to treat it as part of the prose. However, Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi informs me (private communication) that the passage at <span class="sclinktext">MN 49:25.1</span> is in meter and therefore clearly verse.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="43">Moreover, both of the above passages are spoken to non-monastics (the householder Kevaddha and Baka the <em>brahmā</em>), neither of whom seems particularly well-versed in the Buddha’s teachings. Generally, at the time of the Buddha it was the monks and nuns who were the experts on the Buddhist doctrine. Most <em>suttas</em> spoken to lay Buddhists are simple and straightforward practical instructions. It seems quite possible, therefore, that the usage here of <em>anidassana</em> is simply evocative, not a precise reference to a specific state.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="44">i.e. ‘<em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ</em>’ in the present case.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="45">The first two immaterial attainments are known respectively as <em>ākāsānañcāyatana</em>, ‘the base of unlimited (<em>ananta</em>) space’, and <em>viññāṇañcāyatana</em>, ‘the base of unlimited (ananta) consciousness’ (e.g. at <span class="sclinktext">MN 64:13.1, 14.1, 15.1</span>).
					<p>Moreover, it seems that <em>ananta</em> is never used with mind or consciousness apart from describing states of <em>samādhi</em>. It never seems to be used to describe the ‘normal’ consciousness of the <em>arahant</em>, for example.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="46">This semantic closeness becomes particularly important with verse. Due to metrical constraints, words which may have slightly different import in prose often become interchangeable in verse.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="47">E.g. with <em>kasiṇa</em> meditation at <span class="sclinktext">MN 77:23.5, 23.11, 24.2, 24.11</span>, and with <em>samādhi</em> more generally at <span class="sclinktext">AN 5.45:2.2–4.1</span>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="48">Of course, the mind without hindrances could also be a reference to the mind of the <em>arahant</em>, but <em>pabhassara</em> does not seem to be used in this sense. See for example <span class="sclinktext">SN 46.33</span> and <span class="sclinktext">AN 5.23</span>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="49">Of the three lines of the first verse, the first and the third line end with present tense indicative verbs. Thus we seem to have two separate sentences, each being a question. Moreover, while the Pali is ambiguous as to whether the response gives one or two answers, the parallel passage in the Chinese Canon (see below) seems to give two.
					<p>It might be objected that the lead-up to the verses at <span class="sclinktext">DN 11:85.11–85.27</span> only contains one question. Why would the Buddha reformulate a single question into two? According to <span class="sclinktext">AN 4.42:1.1–1.7</span> there are four ways of answering a question, one of which is using analysis. In the present case, the original question clearly has more than one answer (as will become clear below), and thus the Buddha’s reformulation may simply be a response to this fact.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="50">Note the ‘this’, <em>etaṁ</em>, in the last line of the answer verse. This would seem to refer back to <em>nāmañ ca rūpañ ca</em> of the previous line; that is, these lines are connected. Thus the last line cannot simply be regarded as an ‘add-on’ which does not refer to any of the questions in the question verse.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="51">Taking this verse in isolation, the most obvious candidate for this would be the immaterial attainments. But the use elsewhere of the phrase ‘where earth, water, fire and air find no footing’ (see in particular <span class="sclinktext">Ud 1.10:14.1–15.4</span> and <span class="sclinktext">SN 1.27</span>) indicates that it refers to something more profound than the immaterial attainments. It is perhaps a poetic way of expressing a full escape from <em>saṁsāra</em>. See also the discussion below.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="52">I take ‘long and short, small and great, fair and foul’ to be poetic examples of ‘name-and-form’ and thus to be included within name-and-form. In the <em>suttas</em> name-and-form is usually understood to encompass all phenomena apart from consciousness.
					<p>It is significant that the Chinese version of these verses (at T I 102c, 14–19) supports the above analysis. The question verse of the Chinese is virtually identical with the question verse of the Pali. (In both versions, this verse is the Buddha’s reformulation of the original single question into two questions.) The answer verse is as follows: ‘one should answer (應答): “Consciousness without form (識無形); infinite, self-illuminating (無量自有光); when this ceases then the four great [elements] cease (此滅四大滅); gross, subtle, beautiful, ugly cease (麤細好醜滅滅); therefore name-and-form cease (於此名色滅); consciousness ceases, remainder also ceases (識滅餘亦滅)”‘. Here it is quite clear that we have two answers. The first one is ‘consciousness without form, infinite, self-illuminating’. This would then be the answer to the first question about where the four elements cease or find no footing. Since the second line begins ‘when this ceases ...’, ‘this’ presumably referring back to the consciousness without form of the previous line (it is difficult to see what else it might refer to), this must be a second answer. This answer would correspond to the second question, concerning where name and form wholly cease. (Admittedly, the Chinese is a bit confusing here, since it starts the second answer with ‘then the four great elements cease’. I take this mention of the four great elements as simply an elaboration on some of the aspects of name-and-form.) Moreover, it is clear in the Chinese that the ‘consciousness without form’ cannot be a reference to <em>Nibbāna</em> since it ceases together with all other phenomena.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="53">If, on the other hand, ‘all’ is not to be regarded as equivalent to <em>saṁsāra</em> in its entirety, then <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> potentially becomes correspondingly broader. For example, if ‘all’ here instead only refers to everything within Baka the Brahmā’s knowledge (Baka the Brahmā being the Buddha’s interlocutor in the passage at <span class="sclinktext">MN 49:25.1</span>), then <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> could be a reference to the immaterial attainments.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="54">This does not require this consciousness to exist ‘outside’ of <em>saṁsāra</em>. rather, it is a type of consciousness which is based on the full understanding of the <em>Dhamma</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="55">There are, in fact, good reasons for questioning whether this passage should be included in our analysis at all, since the reading in the above <span class="sclinktext">MN 49:25.1</span> quote is very uncertain. According to the Burmese version of this verse, it is the Buddha who speaks it, referring to his own special understanding. However, according to the Sri Lankan, the Thai, and the PTS versions of this verse, it is spoken by Baka the Brahmā, referring to his special understanding (see Anālayo, forthcoming, footnote 162 to MN 49). This is obviously highly significant, because if this refers to Baka the Brahmā’s knowledge, then <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> must refer to a state of consciousness that he can access, i.e. most likely a <em>jhāna</em> state. This interpretation is further reinforced by the Chinese version of this <em>sutta</em>, also according to which it was Brahmā who spoke, see T I 548b, 11. (It is also significant that in the Chinese there is no equivalent of <em>anidassana</em>.) Given this uncertainty in the reading, it would be quite reasonable, maybe even preferable, to leave the passage at <span class="sclinktext">MN 49:25.1</span> out of the present discussion. In spite of this, I have decided to incorporate the passage in my argument.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="56">This may also explain the usage of the term <em>anidassana</em>. According to our analysis, being accessible only to <em>ariyas</em>, <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> is ‘non-manifest’ (i.e. inaccessible) to all <em>puthujjanas</em>, including the devas of the very highest realms.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="57">This is the <em>samādhi</em> referred to at <span class="sclinktext">AN 3.32</span>, <span class="sclinktext">AN 10.6</span>, <span class="sclinktext">AN 11.7</span>, and <span class="sclinktext">AN 11.8</span>.
					<p>As mentioned in the introduction, and contrary to the view of some, I do not regard this consciousness as taking <em>Nibbāna</em> as its object. Rather, I see this as a <em>samādhi</em> gained through a particular perception that is based on the knowledge of what <em>Nibbāna</em> is.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="58">Nor would it refer to an <em>ariya’s</em> direct experience of <em>Nibbāna</em> during life: see my discussion of <em>ariya-samādhi</em> in the introduction.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="59">Harvey also sees this state of consciousness as experienceable by <em>arahants</em> during life, but different from their ordinary consciousness (1995, 201–203). Here, however, I will focus on the aspect of final <em>Nibbāna</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="60">I understand this passage to be another way of saying that consciousness is not attached to anything; it does not grasp at anything or take anything up. Because of being unestablished in this way, it does not get established in, i.e. commence, a new existence. That is, the passage concerns the cessation of the source of consciousness. Upon the attainment of <em>arahant</em>-ship, consciousness becomes devoid of the kind of desire that would otherwise have caused the future establishment of consciousness in a new rebirth. for the <em>arahant</em>, the source of consciousness has ceased, but consciousness itself only ceases when he dies.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="61">See the general discussion on consciousness above.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="62">The spelling <em>apatiṭṭhitaṁ</em> seems to be an error for <em>appatiṭṭhitaṁ</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="63">The expression ‘being unagitated, he personally attains <em>Nibbāna</em>’, is a common way in the <em>suttas</em> to describe <em>Nibbāna</em> in this life, i.e. the attainment of <em>arahant</em>-ship as opposed to final <em>Nibbāna</em>. See for instance <span class="sclinktext">MN 140:22.12</span>, where <em>Nibbāna</em> is described in similar terms, but final <em>Nibbāna</em> clearly happens later. Also note that in this case consciousness in fact becomes unestablished immediately prior to the attainment of <em>arahant</em>-ship. This strengthens the argument further.
					<p><em>Appatiṭṭhita</em> also recurs at Ud 80 where it seems to qualify a particular ‘state’ (of <em>samādhi</em>, perhaps) of the living <em>arahant</em>. Since it concerns an <em>arahant</em>, his consciousness is by definition <em>appatiṭṭhita</em>, ‘unestablished’, as discussed above. for further discussion of Ud 80 see section on <em>Nibbāna</em> below.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="64">Johansson (1969, 131) states that ‘The new, transformed state of <em>citta</em> is <em>Nibbāna</em> ...’ He then claims that this <em>citta</em> continues after the death of the <em>arahant</em>: ‘But when an <em>Arahant</em> dies ... the “stillness” and “emptiness” of the <em>citta</em> makes it survive, free and anonymous ...’ (133). Johansson evidently takes a particular state of <em>citta</em> as equivalent to final <em>Nibbāna</em>.
					<p>A similar position seems to be taken in Mahā Boowa (1980, 23): ‘the <em>citta</em> by its very nature is <em>amataṁ</em> - Undying ...’; ‘Once <em>paññā</em> has totally shattered and cleared the <em>kilesas</em> away, the <em>citta</em> will be transformed into the state of purity ... How can it vanish? ... this one is the genuine <em>amataṁ</em> (the Undying). Immortal by way of purity ... This is the real and true substance or essence which is in the midst of our <em>khandha</em>’ (45); ‘The <em>kilesas</em> can’t destroy the <em>citta</em> ... This nature is unassailable, absolute and permanent. It cannot be annihilated’ (76). It must be kept in mind, however, that the teachings given by Thai meditation teachers are often difficult to interpret. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, the idiom of Thai meditation teachers, particularly those associated with the Thai forest tradition, is notoriously idiosyncratic. They rarely use the expressions and words found in the <em>Nikāyas</em>, and if they do, they sometimes give these expressions new meanings. Secondly, the language they use is often not very precise, at least compared with that of the <em>suttas</em>, and thus there are significant problems of interpretation. Thus it is possible that Ven. Ajahn Mahā Boowa may be referring to something other than the English translation appears to show. Still, the translation as it stands is hard to square with the descriptions of <em>Nibbāna</em> and <em>citta</em> in the <em>suttas</em>.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="65">In the <em>Vinaya-Piṭaka</em> the Buddha typically asks a monk who thinks he may have committed an offense, <em>kiṁcitto</em>, ‘what (was your) intention?’, e.g. at <a class="extlink tipref" href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali?layout=sidebyside&reference=main/pts&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin#7.6.8">Bu Pj 2:7.6.8</a>. <em>Citta</em> seems to mean ‘thought’ in the standard description of thought-reading, e.g. at <span class="sclinktext">DN 11:6.0–7.8</span>. For a further sense of the wide use of the term <em>citta</em> see PED.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="66">cf. CDB, 769, n.154.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="67">The use of <em>citta</em> here, in place of <em>viññāṇa</em>, could perhaps be under the influence of the <em>abhidhamma</em>. see Ven. Anālayo’s study of the Anupada Sutta, MN 111, in Anālayo forthcoming.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="68">‘<em>Citta</em>’ which is usually translated as ‘mind’ is here translated as ‘thought’ because ‘mind’ does not really fit the context. Perhaps ‘mental state’ would be a better translation.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="69">It seems clear that <em>citta</em> is often regarded as including other mental factors apart from <em>viññāṇa</em>. See discussion above.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="70">In both this quote and the one below the singular ‘<em>yaṁ ca kho etaṁ/idaṁ</em>’, ‘and that/this which’, is used. Thus ‘<em>citta</em>’, ‘<em>mano</em>’, and ‘<em>viññāṇa</em>’ refer to the same entity. Also note that Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi here has translated ‘<em>itipi</em>’ with ‘and’, a translation normally used for ‘<em>ca</em>’. A more literal translation of ‘<em>itipi</em>’ might be ‘also’ or ‘too’: ‘But, bhikkhus, as to that which is called mind, also mentality, also consciousness’. It is significant that this phrase is also found in the Chinese and the Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit versions of this <em>sutta</em>, cf. respectively T II 81c, 7 and <em>Tripāṭhī</em>, folio 5 V3.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="71">Apparently the Tibetan counterpart to this sutta has the equivalent phrase; cf. Weller, 1934: 26.
					<p><span class="sclinktext">MN 138</span> provides another striking example of <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>citta</em> being used interchangeably. In the summary at the beginning of the <em>sutta</em>, at <span class="sclinktext">MN 138:3.1</span>, <em>viññāṇa</em> is used. Later on in the same sutta, in the section explaining this <em>viññāṇa</em>, <em>citta</em> is used in its place; see <span class="sclinktext">MN 138:12.3, 13.2, 14.2, 15.2, 16.3, 17.2, 18.2, 19.2</span>. Further, in the explanation itself, <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>citta</em> are used together.</p>
					<p>For further references to the interchangeability of <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>citta</em> in non-Pali Buddhist texts (i.e. primarily Chinese and Sanskrit sources), see Anālayo forthcoming, footnote 168 to <span class="sclinktext">MN 138</span>.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="72">This passage refers to a wrong view.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="73">Although I have argued in the above section concerning <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> that the interpretation of verse is often difficult, this becomes particularly relevant if a verse is interpreted in a way that is contrary to what can be established from canonical prose passages alone. In the present case, the verses merely reinforce what can be established elsewhere.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="74">The translation is based on the alternative reading ‘<em>vimariyādikataṁ</em>’ in the last line.
					<p>Norman’s translation of ‘<em>vidhamissati</em>’, ‘will blow away’, can probably be improved upon. other possible translations include: ‘will be demolished’ (cf. CDB, p.985), ‘will be ruined’, ‘will fall away’, and ‘will be destroyed’.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="75">See also Anālayo 2003: 191, n.39.
					<p>My understanding is that the radiance is always available, it is only matter of overcoming the hindrances. But when the defilements are present the mind is not radiant: otherwise we would be able to observe that radiance, since the mind can only be known through direct experience.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="76">Whether the other <em>ariyas</em> would know of such a <em>citta</em> seems unclear. See my discussion of <em>ariya-samādhi</em> in the introduction.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="77">Following Harvey’s approach, one might alternatively call this a ‘timeless (mode of) mind’. I have already discussed why the idea of ‘timelessness’, in my opinion, does not add anything new. See discussion of <em>viññāṇa</em> above.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="78">Moreover, consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>) is also occasionally said to be ‘freed’; see in particular <span class="sclinktext">SN 22.53:3.8–3.9</span> & <span class="sclinktext">SN 22.54:4.8–4.9</span>, above. If ‘mind’ has a distinct meaning in the phrase ‘the mind is liberated’, then the same would have to be true for <em>viññāṇa</em> in this parallel construction. But we have already seen that the Buddha rejects the idea of <em>viññāṇa</em> as a permanent entity.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="79">See for example the <em>asaṅkhata-saṁyutta</em> ( <span class="sclinktext">SN 43.12</span>/<span class="sclinktext">SN 43.13</span>/<span class="sclinktext">SN 43.14-43</span>) where there are 32 synonyms for <em>Nibbāna</em>, none of which is <em>citta</em> or any particular state of <em>citta</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="80">As with <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>citta</em>, <em>mano</em> and <em>citta</em> have their own more or less distinct spheres of usage in the <em>suttas</em>. Sometimes in the analysis of mental processes the Buddha uses <em>mano</em> to describe the mind in relation to mind-consciousness but not in relation to the other five types of consciousness. In this analysis, <em>mano</em> is the sense through which mind-consciousness arises. <em>Citta</em>, on the other hand, apparently encompasses all six types of consciousness. outside such technical usage, however, <em>mano</em> and <em>citta</em> seem to be used synonymously.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="81">This passage concerns mind reading.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="82">Both <em>mano</em> and <em>citta</em> are usually translated as ‘mind’. When the words are used together in the suttas, translators often seem to struggle to find a second English word that also means ‘mind’ (cf. CDB, 769, n.154).
					<p>The following two examples are also instructive of the close relationship between <em>citta</em> and <em>mano</em>:</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‘A mind of ill-will (<em>vyāpanna-citto</em>), mental intention of hate (<em>paduṭṭha-mana-saṅkappo</em>)’. (SN III 93, my translation)</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‘An undaunted mind (<em>apatitthīna-citto</em>), a non-dejected mind (<em>adīna-mānaso</em>), a mind without ill-will (<em>avyāpanna-cetaso</em>)’. (SN V 74 but cf. CDB, 1904, n.69; my translation)</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>In the above <em>mano</em> and <em>citta</em>, as well as <em>ceto</em>, seem to be used as synonyms.</p>
					<p>Yet another example of this close relationship is the use of <em>kāya</em> (body), <em>vācā</em> (speech), and <em>mano</em> (mind) to denote the three doors of wholesome and unwholesome actions; occasionally the three doors are denoted as <em>kāya</em>, <em>vācā</em>, and <em>citta</em>; cf. SN II 231, SN II 271 and SN IV 112. See also Dhp 348 where one finds <em>vimutta-mānaso</em> in place of the standard <em>ceto-vimutti</em>.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="83">That is, the cessation of the five aggregates. This does not imply anything except the cessation of an entirely impersonal process. This is very different from the annihilation of a permanent entity. See discussion below.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="84">I use quotes here and below to emphasize that such a ‘state’, or ‘existing entity’, would be completely different from anything that can normally be experienced by human beings. Thus the word ‘state’ is only used for lack of suitable terminology.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="85">Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu (1993, 4) also seems to support the idea that final <em>Nibbāna</em> is more than mere cessation: ‘As for the question of how <em>nibbana</em> is experienced after death, the Buddha says that there is no limit in that experience by which it could be described’. Note in particular the words ‘that experience’, referring to <em>Nibbāna</em> after the death of the <em>arahant</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="86">Or it may be called <em>asaṅkhatadhātu</em>, see MN III 63, 13, or <em>amatadhātu</em>, see AN III 356,14.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="87">It also ignores the distinction between <em>Nibbāna</em> and final <em>Nibbāna</em>. From the definition of <em>Nibbāna-dhātu</em> at SN V 8, see below, it seems clear that it refers to the state of <em>arahant</em>-ship, not final <em>Nibbāna</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="88">That is, property in the sense of quality.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="89">The point of these expressions is presumably simply to point out that there are such things as cessation and renunciation.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="90">That is, the extinguishment of the defilements of lust, hatred and delusion.
					<p>Moreover, <em>dhātu</em> is used for <em>saññāvedayitanirodha</em>, the cessation of perception and feeling (SN II 150). In this case it can clearly not refer to an element as something existing. rather, it seems to refer to the existence of the possibility of the cessation of the mental <em>khandhas</em>.</p>
					<p>The word <em>pada</em>, lit. ‘foot’, has a similarly broad application. For example, the expression <em>amataṁ padaṁ</em> (e.g. at AN II 51, 29), which is used as a synonym for <em>Nibbāna</em>, might perhaps be rendered ‘the characteristic of freedom from death’; see PED. (See discussion of Ud 80 below (second <em>sutta</em>) for why <em>amataṁ</em> is better rendered as ‘freedom from death’ than ‘the deathless’. See also CPD.)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="91">My translation, based on Bodhi 2005.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="92">See introduction. This <em>samādhi</em> is described at AN V 7–9 and AN V 318–326. (AN I 132–134 is also closely related.) The only difference is the absence of ‘neither sun nor moon’ in the AN passages. The sun and moon seem to have been regarded as belonging to ‘another world’ in ancient India (see dN II 319, 23), and thus the inclusion of this expression does not seem to add anything new. I would regard its addition to Ud 80 simply as poetic flourish.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="93">E.g. the immaterial attainments are all called <em>āyatana</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="94">But note that the Ud 80 verse includes the word <em>ṭhitiṁ</em> which is not found in the parallel passages. It seems likely that this refers to the ‘remaining’ in a particular existence, between one’s arising there and one’s subsequent passing away.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="95">Or an equivalent formulation such as <em>ārammaṇe asati</em>, e.g. at SN II 66, 1.
					<p>Harvey (1995, 203) translates <em>anārammaṇa</em> as ‘without object’. However, in relation to SN II 65–67 the commentary glosses the term with <em>paccaya</em>, ‘condition’ or ‘basis’. I cannot see any reason why the commentarial explanation should be rejected. (In the <em>Abhidhamma</em>, however, <em>ārammaṇa-paccaya</em>, seems to have the sense of object-condition.)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="96">Alternatively, or additionally, it might refer to <em>saññāvedayitanirodha</em> or perhaps even <em>ariya-samādhi</em> itself. This being verse, the ambiguity could be deliberate.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="97">It is usually further assumed that this positively existing something is final <em>Nibbāna</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="98">Moreover, by interpreting the Buddha’s reflection to refer to an ‘unborn state’ one is adding a pre-condition to the Buddha’s search that reduces the sphere of potential solutions. It seems unlikely that the Buddha-to-be would add a stipulation which might stop him from reaching his goal.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="99">The same argument would hold true of <em>amataṁ</em>, which occurs in the same context at MN I 163, and which therefore should be translated as ‘freedom from death’.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="100">Either in the sense of attaining <em>arahant</em>-ship or in the sense of final <em>Nibbāna</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="101">The broader passage reads as follows: ‘If, monks, there were no freedom from what is born ... no freedom from what is produced, no escape would be discerned from what is born ... from what is produced’. In other words, if there were no such thing as the cessation of the <em>khandhas</em>, then no escape from suffering would be possible. See discussion below.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="102">See discussion in footnote 7 above.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="103">In this context it is significant that in the suttas one of the most common synonyms for <em>Nibbāna</em> is <em>nirodha</em>, ‘cessation’.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="104">Harvey (1995, 201–203) also discusses a number of passages in the <em>Saṁyutta Nikāya</em> in support of his interpretation of final <em>Nibbāna</em> (as well as <em>Nibbāna</em> in life, but here the discussion concerns final <em>Nibbāna</em>). All of these suttas revolve around the idea of unestablished consciousness, <em>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</em>, which I have already discussed above. Again, the idea of unestablished consciousness quite clearly refers to the living <em>arahant</em> and there seems to be no reason to take it as referring to final <em>Nibbāna</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="105">Or that it can be experienced by any <em>ariyan</em>. see for instance Bodhi (2005, 318) and Harvey (1995, 210).</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="106">See for instance Bodhi (2005, 379): ‘... his mind ... focuses upon the deathless element, <em>Nibbāna</em>’. see also footnote 12 above.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="107">In the <em>Nikāyas</em>, on a large number of occasions, the six senses, their objects, and the six corresponding classes of consciousness are all said to be impermanent and suffering (e.g. at SN IV 25). No exception is ever explicitly mentioned. clearly <em>Nibbāna</em> cannot be part of this scheme.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="108"><em>The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English</em>, 1995, ninth edition.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="109">Such as a ‘timeless’ consciousness or a seventh class of consciousness.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="110">It might be objected that occam’s razor is primarily applicable to scientific explanations. But scientific explanations are explanations of real and observable phenomena, and from a Buddhist point of view the extinguishment that happens at final <em>Nibbāna</em> is also a real and (in some ways) observable phenomenon.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="111">And if, as suggested above, such a ‘state’ of final <em>Nibbāna</em> cannot be experienced even by <em>arahants</em>, the same would be true of all <em>ariyas</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="112">Could such a view of final <em>Nibbāna</em> lead to <em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>, a craving for annihilation? Possibly it could. But it seems to me that it is far more common for people to hold an eternalist view than an annihilationist view. Moreover, the Buddha himself considered the annihilationist view superior; see my discussion immediately below. In other words, although ideally one should realize that the Buddha taught neither eternalism nor annihilationism (see next section), it is preferable to err on the side of annihilationism.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="113">Since the idea that final <em>Nibbāna</em> is an ‘existing entity’ would seem to be closer to eternalism than annihilationism.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="114">Because annihilationism is ‘the view of outsiders’.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="115">The words <em>arahant</em> and <em>Tathāgata</em> appear to be used synonymously in this sutta.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="116">That is, after he has fully penetrated it with insight. He seems to have attained stream-entry while Sāriputta was teaching him.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="117">See for instance SN III 33–34: ‘form ... feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness is not yours: abandon it. When you have abandoned it that will lead to your welfare and happiness’. The <em>sutta</em> then gives the well-known simile of the grass, sticks and leaves in the Jetavana: just as the monks do not identify with those things, so too they should not identify with the five <em>khandhas</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="118">That is, nothing is annihilated from the arahant’s point of view. once <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em> (seeing a permanent self in the <em>khandhas</em>) is abandoned, the perception that an <em>arahant</em> can be annihilated is also abandoned. The death of an <em>arahant</em> is just the end of suffering. This is the point of the <em>Yamaka Sutta</em>, see above.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="119">Harvey (1995, 240) states that ‘as ... <em>only dukkha</em> ends at the death of an Arahat, the total non-existence of a <em>Tathāgata</em> beyond death seems to be ruled out’. But the point of the <em>Yamaka Sutta</em>, and indeed the <em>suttas</em> taken more broadly, is that there is nothing but <em>dukkha</em> even prior to the death of the <em>arahant</em>. This is how the <em>bhikkhunī</em> Vajirā expresses this:
					<p>This is a heap of sheer formations:<br />Here no being is found.<br />...<br />It’s only suffering that comes to be,<br />Suffering that stands and falls away.<br />Nothing but suffering comes to be,<br />Nothing but suffering ceases. (SN I 297; see also SN II 17)</p>
					<p>If everything experienced by an <em>arahant</em>, and indeed all beings, is ultimately <em>dukkha</em>, and all <em>dukkha</em> ceases when an <em>arahant</em> dies, then — even without any further <em>sutta</em> evidence — any view of final <em>Nibbāna</em> existing in some sense is at the very least superfluous, but more likely misleading.(Editor: but note that the above verse is about what ‘comes to be’ and ‘ceases’, which are not seen as characteristics of <em>Nibbāna</em>. Also, it is only said that ‘all conditioned things are <em>dukkha</em>’.)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="120">Since this is the culmination of a long list of pleasures, each in turn superior to the preceding one, the implication is that this is the highest.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="121">How the cessation of all feelings can be considered the highest ‘pleasure’ is explained at AN IV 414–418 and elsewhere.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="122">This is implied by the <em>suttas</em>, since it is <em>sakkāya-ditthi</em> that is responsible for the sense of permanence.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="123">It is not clear whether Mahā-Koṭṭhita himself is caught up in <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>, whether he is testing Sāriputta or whether he is asking the questions for the benefit of others who are present. (According to the commentary the last of these is the correct explanation).
					<p>Concern about the nature of final <em>Nibbāna</em> is essentially the same as speculation about the nature of the <em>Tathāgata</em> after death. In the following quote it is said that such speculation is a result of <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>, the view of personal identity, and that with the abandonment of <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em> such speculation is also abandoned:</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‘What, Master Gotama, is the cause and reason why, when wanderers of other sects are asked such questions, they give such answers as: ... “the Tathāgata exists after death” or “the Tathāgata does not exists after death” ... And what is the cause and reason why, when Master Gotama is asked such questions, he does not give such answers?’</p>
					<p>‘Vaccha, wanderers of other sects regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. They regard feeling as self ... perception as self ... volitional formations as self ... consciousness as self, or self as possessing conscious-ness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. Therefore, when the wanderers of other sects are asked such questions, they give such answers as: ... “the tathāgata exists after death” or “the tathāgata does not exists after death” ... But, Vaccha, the tathāgata, the arahant, the Perfectly enlightened one, does not regard form as self ... self as in consciousness. therefore, when the tathāgata is asked such questions, he does not give such answers.’ (SN IV 395).</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The above taking of a self in relation to the five aggregates is the definition of <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>; see MN I 300.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="124">This does not mean that one may not have a legitimate discussion on the nature of final <em>Nibbāna</em>, only that one has to be very careful not to be ‘taken in’ by <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>. Indeed, one should keep in mind that no matter how hard one tries, there will always be a minimum degree of distortion of reality until <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em> is abandoned.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="125">The view of personal identity will tend to give rise either to an eternalist outlook or to an annihilationist one, since these are the two most obvious destinies of a permanent self. In fact, the commentary relates the above questions to eternalism and annihilationism (Mp III 150, 15).</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="126">When the illusion is seen for what it is, not only does one abandon the idea of a solid core, one also sees that the idea of ownership is an illusion. In this way the entire <em>saṁsāra</em> has lost whatever value it may previously have had.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="127">They are beside the point only in so far as it is cessation that is the true goal. A debate about final <em>Nibbāna</em> is still useful to the extent that it makes this clear. And, given the discussion so far, it is useful for pointing out that postulating anything additional to mere cessation does not make good sense and for showing that seeing final <em>Nibbāna</em> as a ‘state’ may prove obstructive to achieving one’s goal. The concern over ‘is there not anything else?’ relates to annihilationism (again, see Mp III 150, 15), and I have argued that cessation is different from the annihilation of a permanent self.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="128">This passage is almost as explicit as can be that there is nothing apart from <em>dukkha</em> and its cessation.
					<p>It is sometimes argued that the Buddha never speaks of final <em>Nibbāna</em> as just cessation (Bodhi 2005, 319). (Ven. Bodhi in fact uses the word ‘nonexistence’ rather than cessation. Although the term nonexistence is unfortunate since it implies something as existing prior to final <em>Nibbāna</em> — see SN II 17 where the ideas of existence and nonexistence, <em>atthitañ</em> and <em>natthitañ</em>, are presented as false — it seems to me that Ven. Bodhi actually means nonexistence in the sense of (mere) cessation.) But on a number of occasions the Buddha uses terminology that it seems should be understood in just this way, for instance at MN III 245: ‘on the dissolution of the body, with the ending of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here’. At the same time it is hardly surprising that the Buddha should not spend too much time proclaiming that the nature of final <em>Nibbāna</em> is just cessation. Such statements are bound to be misunderstood by the vast majority of people because of their sense of a permanent self (the Buddha is in fact disparaged as an annihilationist in the <em>suttas</em> on a number of occasions, for instance at AN IV 174 and M I 140), and thus it would be counterproductive to teach the <em>Dhamma</em> in this way. It seems that the relative paucity of statements on the nature of final <em>Nibbāna</em> is simply a result of the Buddha being pragmatic as to what teachings would inspire the majority of people who are not <em>ariyas</em>, whether monastic or lay.</p>

		<h1 id="TOCTarget0-1">Preface</h1>
		<p>The only way of moving towards consensus on the controversial subject of the nature of <em>Nibbāna</em><sup>1</sup> is by appealing to the sole source of authority common to practically all Buddhists: the <em>Nikāyas</em>/<em>Āgamas</em>. In the present paper I will first give an overview of the usage of the term <em>Nibbāna</em> in the <em>Nikāyas</em>. I will then argue that, according to the <em>Nikāyas</em>, <em>Nibbāna</em> cannot be regarded as a self. Next, I will point out that the <em>Nikāyas</em> do not see <em>Nibbāna</em> as a form of consciousness, including such exceptional kinds of consciousness as <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> and <em>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</em>. Nor can <em>Nibbāna</em> be regarded as equivalent to mind, or any particular state of mind. In the final section I aim to show that the most reasonable interpretation of the <em>Nikāyas</em> is that final <em>Nibbāna</em> is no more than the cessation of the five khandhas.</p>
		
		<h1 id="TOCTarget0-2">Introduction</h1>
		<p><em>Nibbāna</em> is the goal of Buddhist practice. As such it is only natural that there is great interest in understanding what it might mean to achieve it. At the same time, <em>Nibbāna</em> is the most profound of Buddhist concepts. It is perhaps not surprising then that the concept of <em>Nibbāna</em> has given rise to a large number of interpretations, some based on meditative experience and others on scriptural study and ‘logical’ deduction, and that many of them are mutually contradictory.<sup>2</sup></p>
		<p>Given this confusing situation, the purpose of the present paper is to try to pin down what the Buddha himself meant by <em>Nibbāna</em>. The only satisfactory way of achieving this is to turn to the <em>suttas</em>, for it is the <em>suttas</em> that are the final arbiter in any <em>Dhamma</em> dispute:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Suppose a monk were to say: ‘... this is the <em>dhamma</em>, this is the discipline (<em>vinayo</em>), this is the Master’s teaching’, then, monks, you should neither approve nor disapprove his words. Then, without approving or disapproving, his words and expressions should be carefully noted and compared with the <em>suttas</em> and reviewed in light of the discipline. If they, on such comparison and review, are found not to conform to the <em>suttas</em> or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is not the word of the Buddha, it has been wrongly understood by this monk’, and the matter is to be rejected. But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the <em>suttas</em> or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha, it has been rightly understood by this monk.<sup>3</sup></p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">DN 16:4.8.1–4.8.13</span>
		</div>
		<p>In the following discussion on the nature of <em>Nibbāna</em> I will therefore base my argument, as far as possible, on the complete contents of the <em>Nikāyas</em>.<sup>4</sup> More specifically, I will inquire into the relationship between <em>attā</em>, <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>citta</em> on the one hand and <em>Nibbāna</em> on the other. An understanding of this relationship, as I intend to show, is critical for a proper understanding of <em>Nibbāna</em>. In the final section of this paper, I will discuss <em>Nibbāna</em> itself in greater detail. But to prepare the ground for the ensuing discussion, it is necessary first of all to take a preliminary look at how the <em>suttas</em> employ the term <em>Nibbāna</em>.</p>

		<h1 id="TOCTarget1">An Initial Investigation into the Referents of the term Nibbāna</h1>
		<p>There are three frequently mentioned referents of <em>Nibbāna</em>:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><em>Nibbāna</em> as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion upon the attainment of <em>arahant</em>-ship;</li>
		<li><em>Nibbāna</em> as the ‘state’ that occurs after the death of the <em>arahant</em>; and</li>
		<li><em>Nibbāna </em>as the object of consciousness in a special kind of <em>samādhi</em>. I will briefly discuss each one of these in turn.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>1. Whenever <em>Nibbāna</em> is defined in the <em>suttas</em>, it is always in the same way:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>‘The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this, friend, is called <em>Nibbāna</em>’.<sup>5</sup></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>It is sometimes argued that this ‘destruction’ only refers to the actual event of becoming an <em>arahant</em> (Harvey 1995, 182–185). However, since the destruction is permanent it would seem more likely that <em>Nibbāna</em> here refers to the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion as a general and fundamental characteristic of <em>arahant</em>-ship.<sup>6</sup> Moreover, the event of becoming an <em>arahant</em>, that is the final destruction of the defilements, is presumably instantaneous: either one is an <em>arahant</em> or one is not. But the narrow focus on momentary events, usually known as mind moments, is a characteristic of the <em>abhidhamma</em> and later Pali literature, not the <em>suttas</em>. The <em>suttas</em> normally refer to realities that are extended in time. That this is the case also for the <em>Nibbāna</em> attained at <em>arahant</em>-ship is clear from the following passages:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>When lust is abandoned (<em>rāge pahīne</em>) ... when hatred is abandoned ... when delusion is abandoned one does not intend for one’s own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both and one does not experience mental pain and dejection. It is in this way, brahmin, that <em>Nibbāna</em> is visible in this very life. (<em>transl. Brahmāli</em>)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">AN 3.55:2.2–2.3</span>
		</div>
		<p>Not intending for one’s own or others’ affliction, and not experiencing mental pain and dejection, cannot be momentary. Nor can <em>Nibbāna</em> be momentary in the following description:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>And what, monks, is the <em>Nibbāna</em> element with residue remaining? Here, a monk is an <em>arahant</em>, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge. However, his five senses remain unimpaired, by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable, still feels pleasure and pain. It is the destruction of lust, hatred, and delusion in him that is called the <em>Nibbāna</em> element with residue remaining.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">Iti 44:3.1–3.5</span>
		</div>
		<p>Thus I take <em>Nibbāna</em> in the above definition to refer to that unchanging and permanent aspect of the general state of <em>arahant</em>-ship which is the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion.<sup>7</sup> In this sense <em>Nibbāna</em> is an everpresent reality for the <em>arahant</em>.<sup>8</sup> Moreover, since the destruction of the three root defilements is the standard <em>Nikāya</em> explanation of <em>Nibbāna</em>, it seems reasonable to assume that whenever <em>Nibbāna</em> is used without further qualification it refers to this aspect of the state of <em>arahant</em>-ship. This will be my assumption throughout this paper.</p>
		<hr class="spacer">
		<p>2. Occasionally <em>Nibbāna</em> is used to describe the ‘state’ that occurs after the death of an <em>arahant</em>:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>And what, monks, is the <em>Nibbāna</em> element without residue remaining? Here a monk is an <em>arahant</em>, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge. for him, here in this very life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here [i.e. at death]. that, monks, is called the <em>Nibbāna</em> element without residue remaining.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">Iti 44:4.1–4.4</span>
		</div>
		<p>In the following I will refer to this as ‘final <em>Nibbāna</em>’.<sup>9</sup> In the <em>suttas</em>, only very rarely does the word <em>Nibbāna</em> unambiguously refer to final <em>Nibbāna</em>.<sup>10</sup></p>
		<hr class="spacer">
		<p>3. In a few places the <em>suttas</em> mention a type of <em>samādhi</em> that is attainable only by <em>ariyas</em>:<sup>11</sup></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Just as, friend, in a burning wood-fire, one flame arises and another flame ceases, so too ‘the cessation of existence is <em>Nibbāna</em>, the cessation of existence is <em>Nibbāna</em> (<em>bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ, bhavanirodho nibbānan ti</em>)’, one perception (<em>saññā</em>) arose in me, friend, and another perception ceased, ‘the cessation of existence is <em>Nibbāna</em>’; and yet, on that occasion I was percipient (<em>saññī</em>). (<em>transl. Brahmāli</em>)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">AN 10.7:5.3–5.5</span>
		</div>
		<p>This samādhi is sometimes said to take <em>Nibbāna</em> as its ‘object’,<sup>12</sup> i.e. taking the equivalent of final <em>Nibbāna</em> as its object. However, I cannot see how this explanation can be correct. Final <em>Nibbāna</em> by definition is other than <em>saṁsāra</em>, which means it is other than the six sense bases and their six corresponding classes of objects. In the <em>Nikāyas</em>, consciousness is always defined by the object it takes and consequently there are precisely six classes of consciousness. for <em>Nibbāna</em> to be an object of consciousness, an entirely new class of consciousness would be required, going beyond the established <em>Nikāya</em> taxonomy.<sup>13</sup></p>
		<p>Indeed, the above quote contains sufficient pointers to make it unlikely that this is a direct reference to <em>Nibbāna</em>. Firstly, perception is specifically said to be present. As in the case of consciousness, perception in the <em>suttas</em> is restricted to six classes, all of which are bound up with <em>saṁsāra</em> (<span class="sclinktext">SN 22.57:10.1–10.9</span>). There is no room for a direct perception of <em>Nibbāna</em> in this system of classification. secondly, the perceptions are said to arise and cease, one after the other. Arising and ceasing is a characteristic of <em>saṁsāra</em>, not <em>Nibbāna</em>: <em>Nibbāna</em> is specifically said to be stable (<em>dhuva</em>; <span class="sclinktext">SN 43.20</span>). One would expect a <em>samādhi</em> that takes <em>Nibbāna</em> as its object to be stable, much like the stability of perception found in other deep states of <em>samādhi</em>.<sup>14</sup></p>
		<p>I would therefore propose an alternative interpretation of this passage. It is not <em>Nibbāna</em> as such, but a perception that is based on the <em>ariya’s</em> direct knowledge of the nature of <em>Nibbāna</em>. That is, it is not a perception of <em>Nibbāna</em> but a perception about <em>Nibbāna</em>.<sup>15</sup> For convenience I will refer to this <em>samādhi</em> as <em>ariya-samādhi</em> in the remainder of this paper.<sup>16</sup></p>
		<p>Of these three referents of the term <em>Nibbāna</em>, the first one is relatively straight-forward: it refers to the <em>arahant</em>’s state of having extinguished all defilements.<sup>17</sup> In <em>Nikāya</em> usage this is the usual meaning of <em>Nibbāna</em>. The third referent, <em>ariya-samādhi</em>, does not seem to be a direct reference to <em>Nibbāna</em> at all, but a particular perception based on the full understanding of what <em>Nibbāna</em> is. It is the second referent — that which supervenes at the death of an <em>arahant</em> — which is the most profound and most often misunderstood. It is <em>Nibbāna</em> in this sense, ‘final <em>Nibbāna</em>’, which will be the main focus of this paper.</p>

		<h1 id="TOCTarget2">Is Final Nibbāna a Permanent Self?</h1>
		<p>It is not uncommon to come across attempts to justify the existence of an <em>attā</em> (in the sense of a permanent self) using the Buddha’s teachings and the claim that the end of the Buddhist path is the freeing of this <em>attā</em> from suffering.<sup>18</sup> But the evidence quoted to support such claims is often weak, and it frequently relies on sutta quotes whose interpretation is difficult.</p>
		<p>So let us go through some of the Buddha’s more straightforward statements concerning <em>attā</em>:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Whether there is an arising of <em>Tathāgatas</em> or no arising of <em>Tathāgatas</em>, that element still persists, the stableness of the <em>Dhamma</em>, the fixed course of the <em>Dhamma</em>, that all formations (<em>saṅkhārā</em>) are impermanent ... that all formations are suffering ... that all things (<em>dhamma</em>) are non-self.<sup>19</sup></p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">AN 3.136:1.11–1.15</span>
		</div>
		<p>I would suggest that the Buddha uses ‘<em>dhamma</em>’ in the last phrase to counter any misunderstanding that there might be an <em>attā</em> outside of conditioned phenomena (<em>saṅkhārā</em>). In this context consider the following:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Monks, as far as there are things (<em>dhamma</em>) conditioned (<em>saṅkhatā</em>) or not conditioned (<em>asaṅkhatā</em>), dispassion (<em>virāgo</em>) is reckoned best of those things, that is to say ... <em>Nibbāna</em>. (<em>transl. Brahmāli</em>)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">AN 4.34:3.1–3.2</span>
		</div>
		<p>‘<em>Dhamma</em>’ is thus a wider term than ‘<em>saṅkhāra</em>’. It includes anything that might fall outside of conditioned phenomena, in particular <em>Nibbāna</em>.<sup>20</sup></p>
		<p>Another way of making the same point is as follows:</p>
		<blockquote>

		<h1 id="TOCTarget3">Is Final Nibbāna a Form of Consciousness?</h1>
		<p>It is sometimes argued that even if there is no <em>attā</em>, the purpose of the Buddhist training is to attain a permanent form of consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>).<sup>23</sup> But if there were such a thing as a permanent consciousness devoid of suffering, that would be precisely the sort of phenomenon that the Buddha would describe as a self: it is the characteristics of impermanence and suffering that make the description of something as ‘<em>attā</em>’ impossible.<sup>24</sup> If this argument is accepted, it follows that the idea of a permanent consciousness that is ‘<em>anattā</em>’ is inherently self-contradictory.<sup>25</sup></p>
		<p>It might also be noted here that the mere absence of the thought or perception ‘I am’ in certain states of deep <em>samādhi</em> does not mean that by attaining those states one has penetrated the Buddha’s teaching of <em>anattā</em>. When one emerges from these states the notion ‘I am’ will reappear, often taking that very state of <em>samādhi</em> as its object.<sup>26</sup> As long as the underlying tendency to the view ‘I am’ has not been abandoned, the perception ‘I am’ will always return in spite of such periods of temporary absence.<sup>27</sup></p>
		<p>Let us now turn to what the Buddha said about consciousness:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>‘Is consciousness (<em>viññāṇaṁ</em>) permanent or impermanent?’ – ‘Impermanent, venerable sir’. – ‘Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?’ – ‘suffering, venerable sir’. – ‘Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: ‘this is mine, this I am, this is my self’?’ – ‘No, venerable sir’.</p>

		<p>Of the five aggregates, it is most commonly <em>viññāṇa</em> that is grasped as a self because, although all the other mental factors change continuously, consciousness or awareness can appear to be an independent, unchanging, and ever-present reality.

		<blockquote>
		<p>Consciousness that is permanent (<em>niccaṁ</em>), stable (<em>dhuvaṁ</em>),<sup>30</sup> eternal (<em>sassataṁ</em>), not subject to change: this the wise in the world agree upon as not existing, and I too say that it does not exist.</p>

		<p>It seems clear, then, that final <em>Nibbāna</em> is not a state of consciousness. But if this is so, how is one to understand some of the ‘exotic’ forms of consciousness sometimes mentioned in the <em>suttas</em>, which some commentators take as equivalent to final <em>Nibbāna</em>?<sup>35</sup></p>

		<h1 id="TOCTarget4">Anidassana viññāṇa, Non-Manifest Consciousness</h1>
		<p>One often discussed passage – which only occurs twice in the Pali canon – refers to a form of consciousness known as <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em>:<sup>36</sup> <sup>37</sup></p>
		<blockquote>
		<p class="noindent">‘Where do earth, water, fire and air no footing find?<br />Where are long and short, small and great, fair and foul —<br />Where do name-and-form wholly cease?’</p>

		<p>Consciousness non-manifesting (<em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ</em>), boundless (<em>anantaṁ</em>), all-luminous (<em>sabbato-pabhaṁ</em>).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">MN 49:25.1</span>
		</div>
		<p>It has been suggested that <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> refers to a state of consciousness that is equivalent to final <em>Nibbāna</em> (e.g. Harvey 1995, 201),<sup>40</sup> but in light of the discussion of <em>viññāṇa</em> in the previous section, such an interpretation is untenable. However, to establish the correct interpretation of <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> is far from easy. Firstly, in the whole Pali canon the expression <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> only appears in the above two passages.<sup>41</sup> Secondly, Pali verse is notoriously difficult to translate: the correct Pali reading is often difficult to establish and poetic licence etc. can complicate matters further.<sup>42</sup> Moreover, as in poetry in general, the exact meaning of Pali verse is often vague as its emphasis is on appealing to emotion and intuition rather than on making precise doctrinal statements.<sup>43</sup> Finally, Pali verse often contains rare words and phrases that sometimes occur nowhere else in the <em>tipiṭaka</em>.<sup>44</sup></p>
		<p>Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, and to show that there are other interpretations of <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> that are just as good as or even better than that of a permanent consciousness, I shall put forward an alternative interpretation. To this end, it is necessary to analyse the above quotes in more detail.</p>
		<p>The first thing to note is that, due to the qualifiers <em>ananta</em> and <em>pabhā</em>, <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> is described in a way that resembles the description of certain states of <em>samādhi</em>. <em>Ananta</em> is closely connected to <em>samādhi</em>, and it is specifically used in the standard description of the first two immaterial attainments.<sup>45</sup> Equally important is that <em>appamāṇa</em>, ‘immeasurable’, which is semantically very close to <em>ananta</em>,<sup>46</sup> is very frequently connected with <em>samādhi</em>. In particular, it is used in the standard passage on the divine abidings (<em>brahma-vihāras</em>; e.g. at <span class="sclinktext">MN 7:13.1, 16.1</span>), but it is also employed as a general qualifier of <em>samādhi</em>.<sup>47</sup> As for the second qualifier, <em>pabhā</em>, it does not seem to be used elsewhere to directly qualify <em>samādhi</em>. However, the closely related term <em>pabhassara</em>, ‘shining’, is often used to describe the mind without hindrances (<em>nīvaraṇa</em>), the most obvious example of which is the mind in <em>samādhi</em>.<sup>48</sup> Thus, given the usage of <em>ananta</em> and <em>pabhā</em> in the above quotes, it seems plausible, perhaps even likely, that <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> refers to a state of <em>samādhi</em>.</p>
		<p>Next, it is necessary to look more carefully at the structure of the above verses. For the present purposes, an important fact which is rarely pointed out is that the first verse (the ‘question verse’) in the above <span class="sclinktext">DN 11:85.11–85.27</span> passage seems to contain two questions rather than one.<sup>49</sup> When we turn to the second verse (the ‘answer verse’), it seems that we are again dealing with two separate answers: otherwise there would be a contradiction between the <em>viññāṇa</em> with various attributes described in the first line and the cessation of <em>viññāṇa</em> described in the last line – consciousness cannot be described as <em>anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ</em> and at the same time be said to have ceased. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that the first line of the question verse is answered by the first two lines of the answer verse, and the last two lines of the question verse are answered by the last three lines of the answer verse.<sup>50</sup> If this structural analysis is accepted, then it becomes clear that <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> is simply a form of consciousness where ‘earth, water, fire and air find no footing’;<sup>51</sup> it is not related to the cessation of name-and-form.<sup>52</sup></p>
		<p>At this point we must consider the second passage quoted above (<span class="sclinktext">MN 49:25.1</span>). The wider context of this verse makes it clear that <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> is ‘not commensurate with the allness of all’ (<em>sabbassa sabbattena ananubhūtaṁ</em>), that is, not the same nature as ‘all’. If ‘all’ here is to be understood as ‘all of <em>saṁsāra</em>’, then <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> must be based on an awareness or knowledge of ‘what’ lies beyond <em>saṁsāra</em>.<sup>53</sup>  In other words, <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> must refer to a state of consciousness, perhaps a form of <em>samādhi</em>, possessed by a person who has an ‘outsider’s’ perspective on <em>saṁsāra</em>, one who has seen the potential for <em>saṁsāra</em> to cease.<sup>54</sup> This potential is only known to the <em>ariyas</em>.<sup>55</sup></p>
		<p>Given the above analysis, we are now in a position to be quite specific in our understanding of <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em>. We have seen that <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> is:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>a form of <em>samādhi</em>; and</li>
		<li>that it is a type of consciousness accessible only to the <em>ariyas</em>.<sup>56</sup> </li>
		</ol>
		<p>This description fits well with the type of <em>samādhi</em> I have called <em>ariya-samādhi</em> in the introduction to this paper.<sup>57</sup> This then becomes our interpretation of <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em>.</p>
		<p>In sum, it may never be possible to pin down the exact meaning of <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> with perfect certainty. However, given the broader message of the <em>suttas</em> concerning <em>viññāṇa</em>, and given that there is at least one solid explanation of <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> which does not contradict this broader message, one is forced to reject the idea that <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> is equivalent to the state of final <em>Nibbāna </em>in the form of a permanent (or ‘timeless’) consciousness.<sup>58</sup></p>
		
		<h1 id="TOCTarget5">Appatiṭṭhita Viññāṇa, Unestablished Consciousness</h1>
		<p>The sutta phrase <em>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</em>, ‘unestablished consciousness’, is sometimes taken as referring to final <em>Nibbāna</em>. In this way final <em>Nibbāna</em> is again seen as a ‘state’ of consciousness (see in particular Harvey 1995, 201–203).<sup>59</sup> The following three sutta passages are sometimes used to support this assertion:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>‘If, bhikkhus, there is no lust for the nutriment edible food, or for the nutriment contact, or for the nutriment mental volition, or for the nutriment consciousness, if there is no delight, if there is no craving, consciousness (<em>viññāṇaṁ</em>) does not become established (<em>appatiṭṭhitaṁ</em>) there and come to growth ... Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a house or hall with a peaked roof, with windows on the northern, southern, and eastern sides. When the sun rises and a beam of light enters through a window, where would it become established (<em>patiṭṭhitā</em>)?’ — ‘on the western wall, venerable sir’. — ‘If there were no western wall, where would it become established?’ — ‘on the earth, venerable sir?’ — ‘If there were no earth, where would it become established?’ — ‘on the water, venerable sir’. – ‘If there were no water, where would it become established?’ — ‘It would not become established anywhere (<em>appatiṭṭhitā</em>), venerable sir’. (cf. Harvey 1995, 202)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">SN 12.64:6.1–8.8</span>
		</div>
		<blockquote>
		<p>But, bhikkhus, when one does not intend, and one does not plan, and one does not have a tendency towards anything, no basis exists for the maintenance of consciousness. When there is no basis, there is no support for the establishing of consciousness. When consciousness is unestablished (<em>appatiṭṭhitaṁ</em>) and does not come to growth, there is no descent of name-and-form. With the cessation of name-and-form ... ageing-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. (cf. Harvey 1995, 202)</p>

		<blockquote>
		<p>Monks, with consciousness unestablished (<em>appatiṭṭhitena</em>), the clansman Godhika has attained final <em>Nibbāna</em>. (cf. Harvey 1995, 209–210)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">SN 4.23:10.6</span>
		</div>
		<p>In the first quote above (<span class="sclinktext">SN 12.64:6.1–8.8</span>), there is no good reason why <em>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</em> should be understood as referring to final <em>Nibbāna</em>. Consciousness is said to be unestablished ‘if there is no delight, if there is no craving’. The reference to absence of craving seems to make it fairly straightforward that this concerns the ordinary consciousness of the living <em>arahant</em>.<sup>60</sup></p>
		<p>The second passage (<span class="sclinktext">SN 12.38:3.1–3.5</span>) concerns a person who ‘does not intend’, ‘does not plan’, and ‘does not have a tendency towards anything’. His consciousness is then unestablished and ‘there is no descent of name-and-form’. If, as seems likely, descent of name-and-form refers to future rebirth, then the unestablished consciousness must refer to the living <em>arahant</em>. Indeed, the <em>suttas</em> immediately preceding and following this one, which are direct parallels to it, explicitly mention ‘future rebirth’ (<em>āyatiṁ punabbhavābhinibbatti</em> and <em>āyatiṁ jāti</em> respectively) where the present <em>sutta</em> mentions descent of name-and-form. This leaves little doubt that <em>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</em> also in the present <em>sutta</em> refers to the consciousness of the living <em>arahant</em>. Moreover, the expression ‘when consciousness is unestablished ... there is no descent of name-and-form’ seems to indicate that this concerns consciousness in general, not a specific state. thus, again, this seems to be a reference to an <em>arahant’s</em> general state of consciousness.</p>
		<p>The third passage (<span class="sclinktext">SN 4.23:10.6</span>) is more ambiguous, but it can easily be understood to mean that Godhika’s consciousness was unestablished at the time of death. In other words, there is no need to bring in any theory of final <em>Nibbāna</em> consciousness that, in my opinion, clearly contradicts the <em>suttas</em>’ general message on the subject.<sup>61</sup></p>
		<p>Finally, there are still other passages in the <em>suttas</em> where <em>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</em> clearly refers to the general consciousness of the living <em>arahant</em>:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>When that consciousness is unestablished (<em>apatiṭṭhitaṁ</em>),<sup>62</sup> not coming to growth, nongenerative, it is liberated. By being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains <em>Nibbāna</em>.<sup>63</sup></p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">SN 22.53:3.8–3.9</span> & <span class="sclinktext">SN 22.54:4.8–4.9</span>
		</div>
		<p>In sum, all the available evidence suggests that <em>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</em> is a reference to the ordinary consciousness of the living <em>arahant</em>. Although the <em>suttas</em> do not seem to contain an outright denial that this consciousness applies to final <em>Nibbāna</em>, there is no passage that unambiguously states that it does. In these circumstances, it seems to me little more than speculation to suggest that unestablished consciousness refers to a ‘state’ of final <em>Nibbāna</em>. And given that the existence of a permanent consciousness is explicitly denied elsewhere (see above), it becomes untenable.</p>
		
		<h1 id="TOCTarget6">Could Citta (Mind) be a Referent of Final Nibbāna?</h1>
		<p>Is it reasonable, as is sometimes done, to use the term <em>citta</em> (mind), or a particular state of <em>citta</em>, as a synonym for <em>Nibbāna</em>?<sup>64</sup> There is no clear evidence in the <em>suttas</em> of <em>citta</em> ever being used in this way and, as I shall now try to show, the evidence to the contrary is compelling.</p>
		<p><em>Citta</em> refers to what in English one would understand by ‘mind’. In the <em>Nikāyas</em>, <em>citta</em> often has a broader scope than <em>viññāṇa</em>, sometimes referring to intention for example and at other times to thought.<sup>65</sup> Despite this distinction between the two terms,<sup>66</sup> they are nevertheless closely related. In fact, they are often used synonymously. for example, there are several instances in the <em>suttas</em> where one term appears where one would normally expect to find the other:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>‘When that consciousness (<em>viññāṇaṁ</em>) is unestablished, not coming to growth, nongenerative, it is liberated (<em>vimuttaṁ</em>)’.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">SN 22.53:3.8</span> & <span class="sclinktext">SN 22.54:4.8</span>
		</div>
		<p>Usually it is the <em>citta</em> which is said to be liberated.</p>
		<p>Another example of this is as follows:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>‘With the origination of name-and-form (<em>nāmarūpa-samudayā</em>) there is the origination of mind (<em>cittassa samudayo</em>). With the cessation of name-and-form there is the passing away of mind’.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">SN 47.42:1.8–1.9</span>
		</div>
		<p>It is usually <em>viññāṇa</em> which is said to be thus conditioned by name-and-form. But as the context here is the four <em>satipaṭṭhānas</em>, the third of which is mind contemplation (<em>cittānupassana</em>), citta is used instead.</p>
		<p>Where the <em>suttas</em> analyse the mind into mental factors, <em>viññāṇa</em> usually forms part of the list. In the following passage, however, <em>citta</em> is used in place of <em>viññāṇa</em>:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>And the states in the first <em>jhāna</em> – the applied thought, the sustained thought, the rapture, the pleasure, and the unification of mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind (<em>cittaṁ</em>); the zeal, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention ...<sup>67</sup></p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">MN 111:4.1</span>
		</div>
		<p>Elsewhere, <em>citta</em> and <em>viññāṇa</em> are used together to refer to the same thing: ‘When in his mother’s womb the first thought (<em>cittaṁ</em>) has arisen, the first consciousness (<em>viññāṇaṁ</em>) appeared, his birth is (to be reckoned) from that time’ (<a class="extlink tipref" href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali?layout=sidebyside&reference=main/pts&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin#75.1.8">Kd 1:75.1.8</a>).<sup>68</sup></p>
		<p>This interchangeability of <em>citta</em> and <em>viññāṇa</em> is not surprising when one considers the matter carefully. From the <em>suttas</em> it can be seen that, although <em>viññāṇa</em> as a ‘technical’ term only refers to consciousness or awareness, <em>viññāṇa</em> devoid of other mental factors is merely a theoretical construct which in actual experience does not occur. Thus <em>citta</em>, even in its broadest sense, is implied by <em>viññāṇa</em>:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Feeling, perception and consciousness, friend — these states are conjoined (<em>saṁsaṭṭhā</em>), not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states from the others in order to describe the difference between them. For what one feels, that one perceives; and what one perceives, that one cognises.</p>
		</blockquote>

		</div>
		<p>So whenever there is consciousness, the other mental factors will also be present (cf. <span class="sclinktext">MN 111</span>), and thus <em>viññāṇa</em> is in effect no different from <em>citta</em>.<sup>69</sup> <em>Citta</em> in turn cannot exist without <em>viññāṇa</em>: mind without consciousness is surely an unintelligible concept. Thus, where there is <em>citta</em>, there is also <em>viññāṇa</em>; and where there is <em>viññāṇa</em>, there is also <em>citta</em>. In practice they are inseparable and very closely related:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>‘But, bhikkhus, as to that which is called “mind” (<em>cittaṁ</em>) and “mentality” (<em>mano</em>) and “consciousness” (<em>viññāṇaṁ</em>)’<sup>70</sup>;</p>

		<p>Therefore, if <em>viññāṇa</em> is not permanent and eternal, the same must be true for <em>citta</em>:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Here, a certain ascetic or Brahmin is a logician, a reasoner. Hammering it out by reason, following his own line of thought, he argues: ‘Whatever is called eye or ear or nose or tongue or body, that self is impermanent, unstable, non-eternal, liable to change. But what is called thought (<em>cittaṁ</em>), or mind (<em>mano</em>) or consciousness (<em>viññāṇaṁ</em>), that self is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, the same for ever and ever!’<sup>72</sup></p>

		<p>But, bhikkhus, as to that which is called ‘mind’ (<em>cittaṁ</em>) and ‘mentality’ (<em>mano</em>) and ‘consciousness’ (<em>viññāṇaṁ</em>) — the uninstructed worldling is unable to experience revulsion towards it, unable to become dispassionate towards it and be liberated from it. For what reason? Because for a long time this has been held to by him, appropriated, and grasped thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’. Therefore the uninstructed worldling is unable to experience revulsion towards it, unable to become dispassionate towards it and be liberated from it.</p>
		<p>It would be better, bhikkhus, for the uninstructed worldling to take as self this body composed of the four great elements rather than the mind (<em>cittaṁ</em>). for what reason? Because this body composed of the four great elements is seen standing for one year, for two years, for three, four, five, or ten years, for twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty years, for a hundred years, or even longer. But that which is called ‘mind’ (<em>cittaṁ</em>) and ‘mentality’ (<em>mano</em>) and ‘consciousness’ (<em>viññāṇaṁ</em>) arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by night. Just as a monkey roaming through a forest grabs hold of one branch, lets go and grabs another, then lets that go and grabs still another, so too that which is called ‘mind’ and ‘mentality’ and ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by night.</p>

		<p>Thus, according to the <em>suttas</em>, holding the view that <em>citta</em> in some way can be regarded as permanent, is a mistake. Moreover, when one gains the full <em>ariyan</em> insight into the impermanent and suffering nature of the mind, one feels revulsion (<em>nibbidā</em>) and dispassion (<em>virāga</em>) towards it. And when the <em>arahant</em> attains final <em>Nibbāna</em>, the <em>citta</em> comes to an end:</p>

		<h1 id="TOCTarget7">Pabhassara Citta, the Radiant Mind</h1>
		<p>At <span class="sclinktext">AN 1.49</span> we find the following oft-quoted passage: ‘this mind (<em>cittaṁ</em>), bhikkhus, is radiant (<em>pabhassaraṁ</em>), but is defiled by defilements which arrive’. might this <em>pabhassara citta</em> be an eternal, radiant, and pure mind? It seems clear from the following that this cannot be the case:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>So too, bhikkhus, there are these five corruptions of the mind (<em>cittassa</em>), corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant (<em>pabhassaraṁ</em>) but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. What five? Sensual desire ... ill will ... sloth and torpor ... restlessness and remorse ... doubt is a corruption of the mind, corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<div class="citeBQ">
			<span class="sclinktext">SN 46.33:2.1–2.4</span> & <span class="sclinktext">AN 5.23:2.1–2.4</span><br>
			(cf. <span class="sclinktext">AN 3.102:1.6, 2.5, 3.6</span> & <span class="sclinktext">MN 140:20.1–20.3</span>)
		</div>
		<p>This appears to be the only unambiguous usage of <em>pabhassara</em> in the <em>suttas</em>. It follows that the only reasonable interpretation of <em>pabhassara</em> <em>citta</em> is that it is the mind freed from the five hindrances, the most obvious example of which is the mind in <em>jhāna</em>.<sup>75</sup></p>
		
		<h1 id="TOCTarget8">Does the Term Citta Have Two Fundamentally Distinct Referents?</h1>
		<p>If, as suggested by Harvey (1995), one sees the <em>Nikāyas</em> as including a doctrine of two fundamentally different types of consciousness, i.e. a <em>samsāric</em> consciousness and a timeless <em>Nibbānic</em> consciousness, then, in view of the close relationship between <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>citta</em>, one would expect the <em>Nikāyas</em> to make a similar distinction between two fundamentally different types of <em>citta</em>. Thus the term <em>citta</em> would sometimes refer to the ordinary <em>citta</em> of the <em>puthujjana</em> and at other times refer to a permanent <em>citta</em> known to the <em>arahant</em>.<sup>76</sup> A phrase such as ‘<em>cittaṁ vimuc-cati</em>’ (e.g. at <span class="sclinktext">MN 51:27.2</span>), ‘the mind is liberated’, would then refer to the liberated ‘eternal mind’, or ‘original pure mind’, known to the <em>arahant</em>.<sup>77</sup></p>
		<p>But there is no evidence to support making this distinction. Nowhere in the <em>suttas</em> do we find that two such different realities could both be referred to as ‘<em>citta</em>’. considering the centrality of this issue for the proper understanding of the <em>Dhamma</em>, it seems highly unlikely that the Buddha should have used the term <em>citta</em> in such distinct ways without clearly commenting upon it.<sup>78</sup></p>
		<p>In my opinion, the only possible meaning of such phrases as ‘<em>cittaṁ vimuccati</em>’ is that the ‘ordinary’ mind is liberated from the defilements (<em>āsavā</em>). There is no indication that this mind is somehow permanent. Indeed, one would have expected <em>citta</em> to be used synonymously with <em>Nibbāna</em> if this thesis were correct. But <em>citta</em> is never used in this way in the <em>suttas</em>.<sup>79</sup></p>
