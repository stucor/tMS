		<title>What the Nikāyas Say and Do not Say about Nibbāna - Bhikkhu Brahmāli</title>
		<meta property="og:title" content="What the Nikāyas Say and Do not Say about Nibbāna by Bhikkhu Brahmāli">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Ajahn Brahmali gives an overview of the usage of the term Nibbāna in the Nikāyas. He argues that, according to the Nikāyas, Nibbāna cannot be regarded as a self; that the Nikāyas do not see Nibbāna as a form of consciousness, including such exceptional kinds of consciousness as <span lang='pi'>anidassana viññāṇa</span> and <span lang='pi'>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>; nor can Nibbāna be regarded as equivalent to mind, or any particular state of mind. He aims to show that the most reasonable interpretation of the Nikāyas is that final Nibbāna is no more than the cessation of the five <span lang='pi'>khandhas</span>.</p>">

<h1 id="seg-1">Abstract</h1>
<p id="seg-2">The only way of moving towards consensus on the controversial subject of the nature of Nibbāna is by appealing to the sole source of authority common to practically all Buddhists: the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:sutta" class="sesame">Nikāyas/Āgamas</span>. In the present paper I will first give an overview of the usage of the term Nibbāna in the Nikāyas. I will then argue that, according to the Nikāyas, Nibbāna cannot be regarded as a self. Next, I will point out that the Nikāyas do not see Nibbāna as a form of consciousness, including such exceptional kinds of consciousness as <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> and <span lang='pi'>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>. Nor can Nibbāna be regarded as equivalent to mind, or any particular state of mind. In the final section I aim to show that the most reasonable interpretation of the Nikāyas is that final Nibbāna is no more than the cessation of the five <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>.<sup class="sesame">1</sup></p>
<h1 id="seg-3">Introduction</h1>
<p id="seg-4">Nibbāna is the goal of Buddhist practice. As such it is only natural that there is great interest in understanding what it might mean to achieve it. At the same time, Nibbāna is the most profound of Buddhist concepts. It is perhaps not surprising then that the concept of Nibbāna has given rise to a large number of interpretations, some based on meditative experience and others on scriptural study and ‘logical’ deduction, and that many of them are mutually contradictory.<sup class="sesame">2</sup></p>
<p id="seg-5">Given this confusing situation, the purpose of the present paper is to try to pin down what the Buddha himself meant by Nibbāna. The only satisfactory way of achieving this is to turn to the suttas, for it is the suttas that are the final arbiter in any Dhamma dispute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-6">Suppose a monk were to say: ‘… this is the dhamma, this is the discipline (<span lang='pi'>vinayo</span>), this is the Master’s teaching’, then, monks, you should neither approve nor disapprove his words. Then, without approving or disapproving, his words and expressions should be carefully noted and compared with the suttas and reviewed in light of the discipline. If they, on such comparison and review, are found not to conform to the suttas or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is not the word of the Buddha, it has been wrongly understood by this monk’, and the matter is to be rejected. But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the suttas or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha, it has been rightly understood by this monk’.<sup class="sesame">3</sup></p>

</div>
<p id="seg-8">In the following discussion on the nature of Nibbāna I will therefore base my argument, as far as possible, on the complete contents of the Nikāyas.<sup class="sesame">4</sup> More specifically, I will inquire into the relationship between <span lang='pi'>attā</span>, <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> and <span lang='pi'>citta</span> on the one hand and Nibbāna on the other. An understanding of this relationship, as I intend to show, is critical for a proper understanding of Nibbāna. In the final section of this paper, I will discuss Nibbāna itself in greater detail. But to prepare the ground for the ensuing discussion, it is necessary first of all to take a preliminary look at how the suttas employ the term Nibbāna.</p>
<h1 id="seg-9"><span class="chapnum"> 1</span><br>An Initial Investigation into the Referents of the term Nibbāna</h1>
<p id="seg-10">There are three frequently mentioned referents of Nibbāna:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p id="seg-11">Nibbāna as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion upon the attainment of <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-12">Nibbāna as the ‘state’ that occurs after the death of the <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-13">Nibbāna <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>as the object of consciousness in a special kind of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="seg-14">I will briefly discuss each one of these in turn.</p>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<p id="seg-15">1) Whenever Nibbāna is defined in the suttas, it is always in the same way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-16">‘The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this, friend, is called Nibbāna’.<sup class="sesame">5</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="seg-17">It is sometimes argued that this ‘destruction’ only refers to the actual event of becoming an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> (<span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Harvey 2012a">Harvey 1995</span>, pp.182–185). However, since the destruction is permanent it would seem more likely that Nibbāna here refers to the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion as a general and fundamental characteristic of <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship.<sup class="sesame">6</sup> Moreover, the event of becoming an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>, that is the final destruction of the defilements, is presumably instantaneous: either one is an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> or one is not. But the narrow focus on momentary events, usually known as mind moments, is a characteristic of the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:abhidhamma" class="sesame">Abhidhamma</span> and later Pali literature, not the suttas. The suttas normally refer to realities that are extended in time. That this is the case also for the Nibbāna attained at <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship is clear from the following passages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-18">When lust is abandoned (<span lang='pi'>rāge pahīne</span>) … when hatred is abandoned … when delusion is abandoned one does not intend for one’s own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of both and one does not experience mental pain and dejection. It is in this way, brahmin, that Nibbāna is visible in this very life.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-19"><em>(transl. Brahmāli)</em><br>
<span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.55<span class='scsegments'>:2.2–2.3</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-20">Not intending for one’s own or others’ affliction, and not experiencing mental pain and dejection, cannot be momentary. Nor can Nibbāna be momentary in the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-21">And what, monks, is the Nibbāna element with residue remaining? Here, a monk is an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge. However, his five senses remain unimpaired, by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable, still feels pleasure and pain. It is the destruction of lust, hatred, and delusion in him that is called the Nibbāna element with residue remaining.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-22"><span class="sclinktext">Iti&#8239;44<span class='scsegments'>:3.1–3.5</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-23">Thus I take Nibbāna in the above definition to refer to that unchanging and permanent aspect of the general state of <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship which is the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion.<span id='footnote7' class="anchor"></span><sup class="sesame">7</sup> In this sense Nibbāna is an ever-present reality for the <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>.<sup class="sesame">8</sup> Moreover, since the destruction of the three root defilements is the standard Nikāya explanation of Nibbāna, it seems reasonable to assume that whenever Nibbāna is used without further qualification it refers to this aspect of the state of <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship. This will be my assumption throughout this paper.</p>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<p id="seg-24">2) Occasionally Nibbāna is used to describe the ‘state’ that occurs after the death of an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-25">And what, monks, is the Nibbāna element without residue remaining? Here a monk is an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge. For him, here in this very life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here [i.e. at death]. That, monks, is called the Nibbāna element without residue remaining.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-26"><span class="sclinktext">Iti&#8239;44<span class='scsegments'>:4.1–4.4</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-27">In the following I will refer to this as ‘final Nibbāna’.<sup class="sesame">9</sup> In the suttas, only very rarely does the word Nibbāna unambiguously refer to final Nibbāna.<sup class="sesame">10</sup></p>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<p id="seg-28">3) In a few places the suttas mention a type of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span> that is attainable only by <span lang='pi'>ariyas</span>:<sup class="sesame">11</sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-29">Just as, friend, in a burning wood-fire, one flame arises and another flame ceases, so too ‘the cessation of existence is Nibbāna, the cessation of existence is Nibbāna (<span lang='pi'>bha&shy;va&shy;ni&shy;ro&shy;dho nibbānaṁ, bha&shy;va&shy;ni&shy;ro&shy;dho nibbānan ti</span>)’, one perception (<span lang='pi'>saññā</span>) arose in me, friend, and another perception ceased, ‘the cessation of existence is Nibbāna’; and yet, on that occasion I was percipient (<span lang='pi'>saññī</span>).</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-30"><em>(transl. Brahmāli)</em><br>
<span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;10.7<span class='scsegments'>:5.3–5.5</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-31">This <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span> is sometimes said to take Nibbāna as its ‘object’,<span id='footnote12' class="anchor"></span><sup class="sesame">12</sup> i.e. taking the equivalent of final Nibbāna as its object. However, I cannot see how this explanation can be correct. Final Nibbāna by definition is other than <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span>, which means it is other than the six sense bases and their six corresponding classes of objects. In the Nikāyas, consciousness is always defined by the object it takes and consequently there are precisely six classes of consciousness. For Nibbāna to be an object of consciousness, an entirely new class of consciousness would be required, going beyond the established Nikāya taxonomy.<sup class="sesame">13</sup></p>
<p id="seg-32">Indeed, the above quote contains sufficient pointers to make it unlikely that this is a direct reference to Nibbāna. Firstly, perception is specifically said to be present. As in the case of consciousness, perception in the suttas is restricted to six classes, all of which are bound up with <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span> (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;22.57<span class='scsegments'>:10.1–10.9</span></span>). There is no room for a direct perception of Nibbāna in this system of classification. Secondly, the perceptions are said to arise and cease, one after the other. Arising and ceasing is a characteristic of <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span>, not Nibbāna: Nibbāna is specifically said to be stable (<span lang='pi'>dhuva</span>; <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;43.20</span>). One would expect a <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span> that takes Nibbāna as its object to be stable, much like the stability of perception found in other deep states of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>.<sup class="sesame">14</sup></p>
<p id="seg-33">I would therefore propose an alternative interpretation of this passage. It is not Nibbāna as such, but a perception that is based on the <span lang='pi'>ariya’s</span> direct knowledge of the nature of Nibbāna. That is, it is not a perception of Nibbāna but a perception about Nibbāna.<sup class="sesame">15</sup> For convenience I will refer to this <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span> as <span lang='pi'>ariya-samādhi</span> in the remainder of this paper.<sup class="sesame">16</sup></p>
<p id="seg-34">Of these three referents of the term Nibbāna, the first one is relatively straight-forward: it refers to the <span lang='pi'>arahant’s</span> state of having extinguished all defilements.<sup class="sesame">17</sup> In Nikāya usage this is the usual meaning of Nibbāna. The third referent, <span lang='pi'>ariya-samādhi</span>, does not seem to be a direct reference to Nibbāna at all, but a particular perception based on the full understanding of what Nibbāna is. It is the second referent—that which supervenes at the death of an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>—which is the most profound and most often misunderstood. It is Nibbāna in this sense, ‘final Nibbāna’, which will be the main focus of this paper<span lang='pi'>.</span></p>
<h1 id="seg-35"><span class="chapnum"> 2</span><br>Is Final Nibbāna a Permanent Self?</h1>
<p id="seg-36">It is not uncommon to come across attempts to justify the existence of an <span lang='pi'>attā</span> (in the sense of a permanent self) using the Buddha’s teachings and the claim that the end of the Buddhist path is the freeing of this <span lang='pi'>attā</span> from suffering.<sup class="sesame">18</sup> But the evidence quoted to support such claims is often weak, and it frequently relies on sutta quotes whose interpretation is difficult.</p>
<p id="seg-37">So let us go through some of the Buddha’s more straightforward statements concerning <span lang='pi'>attā</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-38">Whether there is an arising of <span lang='pi'>Tathāgatas</span> or no arising of <span lang='pi'>Tathāgatas</span>, that element still persists, the stableness of the Dhamma, the fixed course of the Dhamma, that all formations (<span lang='pi'>saṅ&shy;khā&shy;rā</span>) are impermanent … that all formations are suffering … that all things (<span lang='pi'>dhamma</span>) are non-self.<sup class="sesame">19</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="seg-39"><span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;3.136<span class='scsegments'>:1.11–1.15</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-40">I would suggest that the Buddha uses ‘<span lang='pi'>dhamma</span>’ in the last phrase to counter any misunderstanding that there might be an <span lang='pi'>attā</span> outside of conditioned phenomena (<span lang='pi'>saṅ&shy;khā&shy;rā</span>). In this context consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-41">Monks, as far as there are things (<span lang='pi'>dhamma</span>) conditioned (<span lang='pi'>saṅkhatā</span>) or not conditioned (<span lang='pi'>asaṅkhatā</span>), dispassion (<span lang='pi'>virāgo</span>) is reckoned best of those things, that is to say … Nibbāna.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-42"><em>(transl. Brahmāli)</em><br>
<span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;4.34<span class='scsegments'>:3.1–3.2</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-43">‘<span lang='pi'>Dhamma</span>’ is thus a wider term than ‘<span lang='pi'>saṅ&shy;khā&shy;ra</span>’. It includes anything that might fall outside of conditioned phenomena, in particular Nibbāna.<sup class="sesame">20</sup></p>
<p id="seg-44">Another way of making the same point is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-45">‘Bhikkhus, you may well cling to that doctrine of self (<span lang='pi'>attavādupādānaṁ upādiyetha</span>) that would not arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who clings to it. But do you see any such doctrine of self, bhikkhus?’—‘No, venerable sir’.—‘Good, bhikkhus. I too do not see any doctrine of self that would not arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who clings to it’.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-46"><span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;22<span class='scsegments'>:23.1–23.5</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-47">Clinging causes suffering because the object of clinging sooner or later changes. If there were such a thing as a permanent self, clinging to it would not give rise to suffering, and the Buddha would not have seen any problem with such clinging.<sup class="sesame">21</sup></p>
<p id="seg-48">But the fact is that the Buddha did not recommend any sort of clinging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-49">When, Nāgita, one dwells contemplating the rise and fall in regard to the five aggregates affected by clinging, repulsiveness in respect of clinging (<span lang='pi'>upādāne pāṭikkūlyatā</span>) is established.</p>

<span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;5.30<span class='scsegments'>:4.12</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-51">In fact, the suttas do not lack clear denials of final Nibbāna being a permanent self:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-52">Bhikkhus, since a self and what belongs to a self are not apprehended as true and established, then this standpoint for views, namely, ‘This is self, this the world; after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity’—would it not be an utterly and completely foolish teaching?</p>

If there was this much individual existence that was permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, this living of the holy life for the complete cessation of suffering could not be discerned’.<sup class="sesame">22</sup></p>

<p id="seg-68">It is sometimes argued that even if there is no <span data-custom-style="Emphasis">attā</span>, the purpose of the Buddhist training is to attain a permanent form of consciousness (<span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span>).<sup class="sesame">23</sup> But if there were such a thing as a permanent consciousness devoid of suffering, that would be precisely the sort of phenomenon that the Buddha would describe as a self: it is the characteristics of impermanence and suffering that make the description of something as ‘<span lang='pi'>attā</span>’ impossible.<sup class="sesame">24</sup> If this argument is accepted, it follows that the idea of a permanent consciousness that is ‘<span lang='pi'>anattā</span>’ is inherently self-contradictory.<sup class="sesame">25</sup></p>
<p id="seg-69">It might also be noted here that the mere absence of the thought or perception ‘I am’ in certain states of deep <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span> does not mean that by attaining those states one has penetrated the Buddha’s teaching of <span lang='pi'>anattā</span>. When one emerges from these states the notion ‘I am’ will reappear, often taking that very state of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span> as its object.<sup class="sesame">26</sup> As long as the underlying tendency to the view ‘I am’ has not been abandoned, the perception ‘I am’ will always return in spite of such periods of temporary absence.<sup class="sesame">27</sup></p>

<p id="seg-106"><span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;49<span class='scsegments'>:25.1</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-107">It has been suggested that <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> refers to a state of consciousness that is equivalent to final Nibbāna (e.g. <span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Harvey 2012a">Harvey 1995</span>, p.201),<sup class="sesame">40</sup> but in light of the discussion of <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> in the previous section, such an interpretation is untenable. However, to establish the correct interpretation of <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> is far from easy. Firstly, in the whole Pali Canon the expression <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> only appears in the above two passages.<sup class="sesame">41</sup> Secondly, Pali verse is notoriously difficult to translate: the correct Pali reading is often difficult to establish and poetic licence etc. can complicate matters further.<sup class="sesame">42</sup> Moreover, as in poetry in general, the exact meaning of Pali verse is often vague as its emphasis is on appealing to emotion and intuition rather than on making precise doctrinal statements.<sup class="sesame">43</sup> Finally, Pali verse often contains rare words and phrases that sometimes occur nowhere else in the <span lang='pi'>tipiṭaka</span>.<sup class="sesame">44</sup></p>
<p id="seg-108">Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, and to show that there are other interpretations of <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> that are just as good as or even better than that of a permanent consciousness, I shall put forward an alternative interpretation. To this end, it is necessary to analyse the above quotes in more detail.</p>
<p id="seg-109">The first thing to note is that, due to the qualifiers <span lang='pi'>ananta</span> and <span lang='pi'>pabhā</span>, <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> is described in a way that resembles the description of certain states of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>. <span lang='pi'>Ananta</span> is closely connected to <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>, and it is specifically used in the standard description of the first two immaterial attainments.<sup class="sesame">45</sup> Equally important is that <span lang='pi'>appamāṇa</span>, ‘immeasurable’, which is semantically very close to <span lang='pi'>ananta</span>,<sup class="sesame">46</sup> is very frequently connected with <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>. In particular, it is used in the standard passage on the divine abidings (<span lang='pi'>brahma-vihāras</span>; e.g. at <span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;7<span class='scsegments'>:13.1, 16.1</span></span>), but it is also employed as a general qualifier of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>.<sup class="sesame">47</sup> As for the second qualifier, <span lang='pi'>pabhā</span>, it does not seem to be used elsewhere to directly qualify <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>. However, the closely related term <span lang='pi'>pab&shy;has&shy;sara</span>, ‘shining’, is often used to describe the mind without hindrances (<span lang='pi'>nīvaraṇa</span>), the most obvious example of which is the mind in <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>.<sup class="sesame">48</sup> Thus, given the usage of <span lang='pi'>ananta</span> and <span lang='pi'>pabhā</span> in the above quotes, it seems plausible, perhaps even likely, that <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> refers to a state of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-110">Next, it is necessary to look more carefully at the structure of the above verses. For the present purposes, an important fact which is rarely pointed out is that the first verse (the ‘question verse’) in the above <span class="sclinktext">DN&#8239;11<span class='scsegments'>:85.11–85.27</span></span> passage seems to contain two questions rather than one.<sup class="sesame">49</sup> When we turn to the second verse (the ‘answer verse’), it seems that we are again dealing with two separate answers: otherwise there would be a contradiction between the <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> with various attributes described in the first line and the cessation of <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> described in the last line—consciousness cannot be described as <span lang='pi'>anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ</span> and at the same time be said to have ceased. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that the first line of the question verse is answered by the first two lines of the answer verse, and the last two lines of the question verse are answered by the last three lines of the answer verse.<sup class="sesame">50</sup> If this structural analysis is accepted, then it becomes clear that <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> is simply a form of consciousness where ‘earth, water, fire and air find no footing’;<sup class="sesame">51</sup> it is not related to the cessation of name-and-form.<sup class="sesame">52</sup></p>
<p id="seg-111">At this point we must consider the second passage quoted above (<span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;49<span class='scsegments'>:25.1</span></span>). The wider context of this verse makes it clear that <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> is ‘not commensurate with the allness of all’ (<span lang='pi'>sabbassa sabbattena ananubhūtaṁ</span>), that is, not the same nature as ‘all’. If ‘all’ here is to be understood as ‘all of <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span>’, then <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> must be based on an awareness or knowledge of ‘what’ lies beyond <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span>.<sup class="sesame">53</sup> In other words, <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> must refer to a state of consciousness, perhaps a form of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>, possessed by a person who has an ‘outsider’s’ perspective on <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span>, one who has seen the potential for <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span> to cease.<sup class="sesame">54</sup> This potential is only known to the <span lang='pi'>ariyas</span>.<sup class="sesame">55</sup></p>
<p id="seg-112">Given the above analysis, we are now in a position to be quite specific in our understanding of <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span>. We have seen that <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p id="seg-113">a form of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-114">that it is a type of consciousness accessible only to the <span lang='pi'>ariyas</span>.<sup class="sesame">56</sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="seg-115">This description fits well with the type of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span> I have called <span lang='pi'>ariya-samādhi</span> in the introduction to this paper.<sup class="sesame">57</sup> This then becomes our interpretation of <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-116">In sum, it may never be possible to pin down the exact meaning of <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> with perfect certainty. However, given the broader message of the suttas concerning <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span>, and given that there is at least one solid explanation of <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> which does not contradict this broader message, one is forced to reject the idea that <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana viññāṇa</span> is equivalent to the state of final Nibbāna <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>in the form of a permanent (or ‘timeless’) consciousness.<sup class="sesame">58</sup></p>
<h1 id="seg-117"><span class="chapnum"> 5</span><br>Appatiṭṭhita Viññāṇa, Unestablished Consciousness</h1>
<p id="seg-118">The sutta phrase <span lang='pi'>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span>, ‘unestablished consciousness’, is sometimes taken as referring to final Nibbāna. In this way final Nibbāna is again seen as a ‘state’ of consciousness (see in particular <span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Harvey 2012a">Harvey 1995</span>, pp.201–203).<sup class="sesame">59</sup> The following three sutta passages are sometimes used to support this assertion:</p>

</div>
<p id="seg-125">In the first quote above (SN 12.64:6.1–8.8), there is no good reason why <span lang='pi'>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> should be understood as referring to final Nibbāna. Consciousness is said to be unestablished ‘if there is no delight, if there is no craving’. The reference to absence of craving seems to make it fairly straightforward that this concerns the ordinary consciousness of the living <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>.<sup class="sesame">60</sup></p>
<p id="seg-126">The second passage (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.38<span class='scsegments'>:3.1–3.5</span></span>) concerns a person who ‘does not intend’, ‘does not plan’, and ‘does not have a tendency towards anything’. His consciousness is then unestablished and ‘there is no descent of name-and-form’. If, as seems likely, descent of name-and-form refers to future rebirth, then the unestablished consciousness must refer to the living <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>. Indeed, the suttas immediately preceding and following this one, which are direct parallels to it, explicitly mention ‘future rebirth’ (<span lang='pi'>āyatiṁ punabbhavābhinibbatti</span> and <span lang='pi'>āyatiṁ jāti</span> respectively) where the present sutta mentions descent of name-and-form. This leaves little doubt that <span lang='pi'>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> also in the present sutta refers to the consciousness of the living <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>. Moreover, the expression ‘when consciousness is unestablished … there is no descent of name-and-form’ seems to indicate that this concerns consciousness in general, not a specific state. thus, again, this seems to be a reference to an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">’s</span> general state of consciousness.</p>
<p id="seg-127">The third passage (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;4.23<span class='scsegments'>:10.6</span></span>) is more ambiguous, but it can easily be understood to mean that Godhika’s consciousness was unestablished at the time of death. In other words, there is no need to bring in any theory of final Nibbāna consciousness that, in my opinion, clearly contradicts the suttas’ general message on the subject.<sup class="sesame">61</sup></p>
<p id="seg-128">Finally, there are still other passages in the suttas where <span lang='pi'>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> clearly refers to the general consciousness of the living <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-129">When that consciousness is unestablished (<span lang='pi'>apatiṭṭhitaṁ</span>),<sup class="sesame">62</sup> not coming to growth, non-generative, it is liberated. By being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna.<sup class="sesame">63</sup></p>

</div>
<p id="seg-131">In sum, all the available evidence suggests that <span lang='pi'>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</span> is a reference to the ordinary consciousness of the living <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>. Although the suttas do not seem to contain an outright denial that this consciousness applies to final Nibbāna, there is no passage that unambiguously states that it does. In these circumstances, it seems to me little more than speculation to suggest that unestablished consciousness refers to a ‘state’ of final Nibbāna. And given that the existence of a permanent consciousness is explicitly denied elsewhere (see above), it becomes untenable.</p>
<h1 id="seg-132"><span class="chapnum"> 6</span><br>Could Citta (Mind) be a Referent of Final Nibbāna?</h1>
<p id="seg-133">Is it reasonable, as is sometimes done, to use the term <span lang='pi'>citta</span> (mind), or a particular state of <span lang='pi'>citta</span>, as a synonym for Nibbāna?<sup class="sesame">64</sup> There is no clear evidence in the suttas of <span lang='pi'>citta</span> ever being used in this way and, as I shall now try to show, the evidence to the contrary is compelling.</p>
<p id="seg-134"><span lang='pi'>Citta</span> refers to what in English one would understand by ‘mind’. In the Nikāyas, <span lang='pi'>citta</span> often has a broader scope than <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span>, sometimes referring to intention for example and at other times to thought.<sup class="sesame">65</sup> Despite this distinction between the two terms,<sup class="sesame">66</sup> they are nevertheless closely related. In fact, they are often used synonymously. For example, there are several instances in the suttas where one term appears where one would normally expect to find the other:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-135">‘When that consciousness (<span lang='pi'>viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span>) is unestablished, not coming to growth, non-generative, it is liberated (<span lang='pi'>vi&shy;mut&shy;taṁ</span>)’.</p>

</div>
<p id="seg-137">Usually it is the <span lang='pi'>citta</span> which is said to be liberated. Another example of this is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-138">‘With the origination of name-and-form (<span lang='pi'>nāmarūpa-samudayā</span>) there is the origination of mind (<span lang='pi'>cit&shy;tas&shy;sa sam&shy;ud&shy;ayo</span>). With the cessation of name-and-form there is the passing away of mind’.</p>

</div>
<p id="seg-140">It is usually <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> which is said to be thus conditioned by name-and-form. But as the context here is the four <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;nas</span>, the third of which is mind contemplation (<span lang='pi'>cittānupassana</span>), <span lang='pi'>citta</span> is used instead.</p>
<p id="seg-141">Where the suttas analyse the mind into mental factors, <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> usually forms part of the list. In the following passage, however, <span lang='pi'>citta</span> is used in place of <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-142">And the states in the first jhāna—the applied thought, the sustained thought, the rapture, the pleasure, and the unification of mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind (<span lang='pi'>cittaṁ</span>); the zeal, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention…<sup class="sesame">67</sup></p>

<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-143"><span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;111<span class='scsegments'>:4.1</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-144">Elsewhere, <span lang='pi'>citta</span> and <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> are used together to refer to the same thing: ‘When in his mother’s womb the first thought (<span lang='pi'>cittaṁ</span>) has arisen, the first consciousness (<span lang='pi'>viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span>) appeared, his birth is (to be reckoned) from that time’ (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#75.1.8" class="extlink tipref">Kd 1</a>:75.1.8).<sup class="sesame">68</sup></p>
<p id="seg-145">This interchangeability of <span lang='pi'>citta</span> and <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> is not surprising when one considers the matter carefully. From the suttas it can be seen that, although <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> as a ‘technical’ term only refers to consciousness or awareness, <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> devoid of other mental factors is merely a theoretical construct which in actual experience does not occur. Thus <span lang='pi'>citta</span>, even in its broadest sense, is implied by <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-146">Feeling, perception and consciousness, friend—these states are conjoined (<span lang='pi'>saṁsaṭṭhā</span>), not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states from the others in order to describe the difference between them.

<p id="seg-174">If, as suggested by <span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Harvey 2012a">Harvey 1995</span>, one sees the Nikāyas as including a doctrine of two fundamentally different types of consciousness, i.e. a <span lang='pi'>samsāric</span> consciousness and a timeless <span lang='pi'>Nibbānic</span> consciousness, then, in view of the close relationship between <span lang='pi'>viññāṇa</span> and <span lang='pi'>citta</span>, one would expect the Nikāyas to make a similar distinction between two fundamentally different types of <span lang='pi'>citta</span>. Thus the term <span lang='pi'>citta</span> would sometimes refer to the ordinary <span lang='pi'>citta</span> of the <span lang='pi'>pu&shy;thuj&shy;jana</span> and at other times refer to a permanent <span lang='pi'>citta</span> known to the <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>.<sup class="sesame">76</sup> A phrase such as ‘<span lang='pi'>cittaṁ vimuccati</span>’ (e.g. at <span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;51<span class='scsegments'>:27.2</span></span>), ‘the mind is liberated’, would then refer to the liberated ‘eternal mind’, or ‘original pure mind’, known to the <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>.<sup class="sesame">77</sup></p>
<p id="seg-175">But there is no evidence to support making this distinction.

<h1 id="seg-199"><span class="chapnum"><span id='chapter10' class="anchor"></span>10</span><br>Final Nibbāna</h1>
<p id="seg-200">The discussion so far has emphasised that, according to the Nikāyas, final Nibbāna cannot be regarded as some sort of permanent or timeless consciousness or mind and that it cannot be regarded as a self (<span lang='pi'>attā</span>). But highlighting what final Nibbāna <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>is not obviously begs the question: What then is final Nibbāna? Indeed, it might be asked, is it anything at all apart from the cessation of existence?<sup class="sesame">83</sup></p>
<p id="seg-201">Before I attempt to answer this question, it is necessary to investigate a number of sutta passages that concern Nibbāna more directly. These passages are often referred to as evidence that final Nibbāna is some sort of ‘state’<sup class="sesame">84</sup> (see for instance <span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Bodhi 2005a">Bodhi 2005</span>, p.318).<sup class="sesame">85</sup> But I would contend that they do not need to be interpreted in this way.</p>
<p id="seg-202">Sometimes Nibbāna is called <span lang='pi'>Nibbānadhātu</span>, e.g. at <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;45.7<span class='scsegments'>:2.4</span></span>.<sup class="sesame">86</sup> The word <span lang='pi'>dhātu</span> is often translated as ‘element’. Basing one’s understanding on this translation it is natural to conclude that Nibbāna must be ‘something’. However, this would be to ignore the range of meanings of the word <span lang='pi'>dhātu</span>.<sup class="sesame">87</sup> In addition to meaning ‘element’, it also has the sense of ‘property’ (see <span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Dict-PED">PED</span>).<sup class="sesame">88</sup> This meaning is prominent in such compounds as <span lang='pi'>nirodha-dhātu</span> (<span class="sclinktext">Iti&#8239;51<span class='scsegments'>:2.3</span></span>), ‘the property of cessation’, and <span lang='pi'>nekkhamma-dhātu</span> (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;14.12<span class='scsegments'>:7.2</span></span>), ‘the property of renunciation’.<sup class="sesame">89</sup> Indeed, <span lang='pi'>Nibbānadhātu</span> itself is explained at <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;45.7<span class='scsegments'>:2.1–2.6</span></span>, as nothing other than ‘the removal (<span lang='pi'>vinayo</span>) of lust, the removal of hatred and the removal of delusion’. Here, again, it is the property aspect which is to the fore, and the best translation would perhaps be ‘the property of extinguishment’.<sup class="sesame">90</sup></p>
<p id="seg-203">Another set of suttas, at <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;43.12</span> / <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;43.13</span> / <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;43.14-43</span>, present 32 synonyms for Nibbāna. This could easily be regarded as evidence of final Nibbāna as an existing ‘state’. However, in this case we need to be careful to distinguish between Nibbāna as an aspect of <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship (i.e. the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion) and final Nibbāna. Because all these suttas are about the destruction of the defilements they would seem to concern <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship.</p>
<p id="seg-204">Two suttas relevant to the present discussion are found at <span data-sesame-key="ud-blurbs:ud-pataligamiyavagga" class="sesame">Ud 8</span>. The first of these reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-205">Monks, there is that base (<span lang='pi'>āyatana</span>) where there is no earth, no water, no fire, no air; no base consisting of the infinity of space, no base consisting of the infinity of consciousness, no base consisting of nothingness, no base consisting of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; neither this world nor another world; neither sun nor moon. I say, bhikkhus, it is not coming, going or remaining, not passing away or reappearing. It is unestablished, not moving, without basis. Just this is the end of suffering.<sup class="sesame">91</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-206"><span class="sclinktext">Ud&#8239;8.1<span class='scsegments'>:3.1–3.4</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-207">The first part of this quote, ‘where there is no earth … neither moon nor sun’, is identical to the standard description of what I call ‘<span lang='pi'>ariya-samādhi</span>’.<sup class="sesame">92</sup> That we are here dealing with a state of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span> would fit well with the use of the word ‘base’, <span lang='pi'>āyatana</span>, which is often used of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span> attainments.<sup class="sesame">93</sup></p>
<p id="seg-208">The second part of the quote, ‘it is not coming, going or remaining, not passing away or reappearing; it is unestablished, not moving, without basis (<span lang='pi'>neva āgatiṁ … na gatiṁ na ṭhitiṁ na cutiṁ na upapattiṁ, appatiṭṭhitaṁ appavattaṁ anārammaṇamevetaṁ</span>)’, seems to be nothing other than a description of <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship. The initial phrase, ‘no coming … or reappearing’, elsewhere refers to <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship (see <span class="sclinktext">Ud&#8239;8.4<span class='scsegments'>:3.5</span></span>, <span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;144<span class='scsegments'>:11.6–11.7</span></span> and cf. <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.40<span class='scsegments'>:1.5–1.6, 2.4–2.5, 3.4–3.5</span></span>): there is no future coming, going, passing away, or reappearing for the <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> as he has cut these things off. They cease here and now because their cause has been removed.<sup class="sesame">94</sup> That ‘unestablished’, <span lang='pi'>appatiṭṭhita</span>, also refers to <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship, I have already shown in the above section on ‘unestablished consciousness’. ‘Without basis’, <span lang='pi'>anārammaṇa</span>,<sup class="sesame">95</sup> is often found together with ‘unestablished’ (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.38</span>, <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.39</span> &amp; <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;12.40</span>) and would therefore also seem to refer to <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship. ‘Not moving’, <span lang='pi'>appavatta</span>, does not seem to be encountered elsewhere in the Nikāyas, but it appears to be a simple reference to ‘not moving in <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span>’, being the opposite of <span lang='pi'>pavatta</span>, ‘moving on’/‘going on’. Again, it seems natural to identify this with <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship.</p>
<p id="seg-209">The final line of the verse, ‘just this is the end of suffering’, would normally refer to the living <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>. ‘Just this is the end of suffering’, or more commonly ‘the end of suffering’, is a standard way of describing the attainment of <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship, e.g. at <span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;144<span class='scsegments'>:11.3–11.9</span></span>. In sum, the above passage at <span class="sclinktext">Ud&#8239;8.1<span class='scsegments'>:3.1–3.4</span></span> seems to describe something related to both <span lang='pi'>ariya-samādhi</span> and <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship. It seems clear therefore that it must relate to Nibbāna, with final Nibbāna perhaps being the most likely candidate.<sup class="sesame">96</sup> But even if this is the case, the word <span lang='pi'>āyatana</span>, like the word <span lang='pi'>dhātu</span>, is used so broadly in the Nikāyas that this would still not be decisive in showing that final Nibbāna is a ‘state’. At <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;9.36</span>, <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;9.43</span> and <span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;9.44</span>, for example, <span lang='pi'>āyatana</span> is used to describe <span lang='pi'>saññāvedayitanirodha</span>, an attainment where the mental aggregates temporarily cease. Clearly <span lang='pi'>āyatana</span> cannot refer to an ‘existing entity’ in such a context.</p>
<p id="seg-210">The other sutta of interest from the Udāna reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-211">‘Monks, there is a freedom from what is born, a freedom from what has become, a freedom from what is made, a freedom from what is produced (<span lang='pi'>atthi bhik&shy;kha&shy;ve ajātaṁ abhūtaṁ akataṁ asaṁkhataṁ</span>)’.</p>

If birth is a problem, then surely the natural thing to do is to seek a freedom from birth, not a ‘state’ that is unborn.<sup class="sesame">98</sup> The most reasonable translation of <span lang='pi'>ajātaṁ</span>, therefore, would seem to be ‘freedom from what is born’ or ‘freedom from birth’.<sup class="sesame">99</sup> If this is accepted, it is natural to translate all the initial <span lang='pi'>a</span>’s at <span class="sclinktext">Ud&#8239;8.3<span class='scsegments'>:3.1–3.4</span></span> as privatives, that is, as ‘freedom from’. According to this interpretation (see my translation above), what is being described here is not necessarily a ‘state’ at all. In my opinion, all this passage does is to affirm the possibility of ending <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span>.<sup class="sesame">100</sup> Indeed, this is precisely the broader context of this extract.<sup class="sesame">101</sup></p>
<p id="seg-214">None of the passages discussed in this section need be read as descriptions of final Nibbāna, let alone as final Nibbāna being ‘something’ in a positive sense. Indeed, it may be that the standard practice of leaving Nibbāna untranslated prejudices our perception of this concept, giving it a sense of a real existing entity when in fact this may not be warranted. If instead we were to translate Nibbāna <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>in accordance with its meaning, perhaps with ‘extinguishment’,<sup class="sesame">102</sup> then our perception of Nibbāna would probably alter accordingly.<sup class="sesame">103</sup></p>
<p id="seg-215">In the end, the passages discussed in this section are not decisive in regard to the ontological status of final Nibbāna.<sup class="sesame">104</sup> This brings us back to the question with which we started the present section: Is final Nibbāna anything at all apart from the cessation of existence?</p>
<h1 id="seg-216"><span class="chapnum"> 11</span><br>Might Final Nibbāna be an ‘Existing Entity’ Entirely Different from the Five Khandhas?</h1>
<p id="seg-217">The reason why the above analysis has not produced any decisive result regarding the nature of final Nibbāna is simply that the suttas very rarely seem to speak of final Nibbāna; their emphasis is on Nibbāna during life, the experience of <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>-ship. Nevertheless, we have seen that final Nibbāna cannot be equated with a form of consciousness or mind. Indeed, it is clear that it must be other than the five <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>. This being the case, could final Nibbāna be a ‘state’, some sort of ‘existing entity’, quite separate from the five <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>?</p>
<p id="seg-218">The idea that final Nibbāna is an ‘existing entity’ is usually matched with the idea that this ‘state’ can be experienced while the <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> is still alive.<sup class="sesame">105</sup> In fact, these two ideas of necessity go together: if the final Nibbāna ‘state’ was not experienceable by living <span lang='pi'>ara&shy;hants</span>, they would not know of its existence and consequently there could be no record of it for posterity. But the idea that final Nibbāna <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>can be experienced by the living <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> is doctrinally problematic. An experience of something—without which one cannot know that it exists—by definition includes consciousness. Thus, an experience of the equivalent of final Nibbāna while alive must involve consciousness. Indeed, this is also the standard explanation for how Nibbāna is said to be experienced: the mind or consciousness takes it as its object.<sup class="sesame">106</sup></p>
<p id="seg-219">The problem with this idea is that it does not fit the Nikāyas’ explanation of consciousness. As I have already pointed out in the introduction to this paper, consciousness is always defined by the object it takes and thus there are precisely six classes of consciousness, one for each of the five senses and one for the mind (e.g. at <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;22.57<span class='scsegments'>:14.1–14.4</span></span>). There is no indication anywhere of any further classes of consciousness. Yet the idea of final Nibbāna as an object of consciousness would require a seventh class of consciousness: it does not fit into any of the six classes mentioned in the suttas.<sup class="sesame">107</sup> Thus, to see consciousness as taking final Nibbāna as its object is to go beyond fixed sutta categories and therefore a baseless extension of what appears to be a full description of reality in the Nikāyas.</p>
<p id="seg-220">More generally, is it sensible to speak of a final Nibbāna ‘state’ that is entirely other than the five <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>? If consciousness ceases once and for all, what could final Nibbāna possibly be? It makes no sense to speak of a ‘state’ which by definition cannot be known. Such a state becomes a mere cipher, something completely devoid of meaning. It is tantamount to not existing at all.</p>
<p id="seg-221">That the idea of final Nibbāna being a ‘state’ is a weak one, is also clear from the principle of Occam’s razor. This philosophical principle states that ‘the fewest possible assumptions are to be made in explaining things’.<sup class="sesame">108</sup> In the present case, all ideas of final Nibbāna being an ‘existing reality’ produce complications—and therefore a need for further assumptions<sup class="sesame">109</sup>—that make these ideas less compelling according to Occam’s razor. The simplest explanation of what happens at final Nibbāna is simply that the five <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span> cease. The simplicity and directness of this idea and its fit, as I have tried to show, with all aspects of the teachings found in the Nikāyas, makes it by far the strongest candidate for explaining final Nibbāna.<sup class="sesame">110</sup></p>
<p id="seg-222">Finally, I wish to point out one remaining danger with insisting that final Nibbāna is a ‘state’ of ‘something’. For a <span lang='pi'>pu&shy;thuj&shy;jana</span> such a ‘state’ would be quite literally unimaginable.<sup class="sesame">111</sup> In trying to understand it, he would quite naturally employ some version of the five <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>. Anyone who accepts the Buddha’s teaching that final Nibbāna is the highest happiness would therefore almost unavoidably grasp at or attach to that version of the five <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>. Because the <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span> can manifest in extremely subtle ways—for instance, for anyone who has not experienced it, it would be virtually impossible to imagine what the experience of the base of nothingness is like—one would quite likely not even be aware of one’s attachment. In this way one ends up grasping the <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>—that is, grasping what is in reality suffering—thinking it to be final Nibbāna. And instead of reaching final Nibbāna one ends up perpetuating <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span>. The view that final Nibbāna is just cessation is thus not only the one that seems most in tune with the Nikāyas but also the one that quite pragmatically is most likely to lead to an exit from <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span>.<sup class="sesame">112</sup></p>
<h1 id="seg-223"><span class="chapnum"> 12</span><br>If Final Nibbāna is Mere Cessation, How is this Different from annihilation?</h1>
<p id="seg-224">At AN 10.29, we find the following revealing passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-225">Monk, among the views of outsiders, this is the highest: ‘I might not be and it might not be mine; I shall not be and it will not be mine (<span lang='pi'>no cassaṁ, no ca me siyā, na bhavissāmi, na me bhavissatī ti</span>)’. For one, monks, who has such a view, it can be expected that he will not feel attracted to existence and will have no aversion to the cessation of existence.</p>

<p id="seg-226"><em>(Adapted from <span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Nyanaponika-Bodhi 1999a">Ñāṇaponika 1999</span> p.246)</em><br>
<span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;10.29<span class='scsegments'>:19.1–19.4</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-227">The view mentioned here is identified as annihilationism at <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;22.81<span class='scsegments'>:11.1–11.15</span></span>. Since annihilationism is always contrasted with eternalism in the Nikāyas, this sutta in effect states that the annihilationist view is superior to the view of eternalism. Again, this undermines any claim that final Nibbāna exists in some sense or other.<sup class="sesame">113</sup></p>
<p id="seg-228">The above quote also makes it clear that the Buddha’s teaching is not annihilationism.<sup class="sesame">114</sup> What then is the distinction between cessation and annihilation? <span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;22.85</span> deals precisely with this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-229">[Ven. Sāriputta:] ‘Is it true, friend Yamaka, that such a pernicious view as this has arisen in you: “As I understand the dhamma taught by the Blessed one, a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated (<span lang='pi'>ucchijjati</span>) and perishes (<span lang='pi'>vinassati</span>) with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death (<span lang='pi'>na hoti paraṁ maraṇā</span>)”?’</p>
<p id="seg-230">[Ven. Yamaka:] ‘Exactly so, friend’.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-231"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;22.85<span class='scsegments'>:3.1–3.3</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-232">Here Yamaka specifically holds the view that an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> is annihilated at death and it is clear from the narrative and Sāriputta’s subsequent questioning of Yamaka that this is contrary to the Dhamma. Sāriputta’s questioning of Yamaka establishes that anything one might take a <span lang='pi'>Tat&shy;hā&shy;gata</span>/<span lang='pi'>arahant</span> to be<sup class="sesame">115</sup>—that is, anything among the five <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>—is all impermanent and suffering. Thus there is no permanent self and therefore no real person/<span lang='pi'>arahant</span>/<span lang='pi'>Tat&shy;hā&shy;gata</span> to be annihilated in the first place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-233">‘What do think, friend Yamaka, do you regard form … feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness as the <span lang='pi'>Tat&shy;hā&shy;gata</span>?’—‘No, friend’.—‘What do think, friend Yamaka, do you regard the <span lang='pi'>Tat&shy;hā&shy;gata</span> as in form … feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness’—‘No, friend’.—‘Do you regard the <span lang='pi'>Tat&shy;hā&shy;gata</span> as apart from form … feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness?’—‘No, friend’.—‘What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness [taken together] as the <span lang='pi'>Tat&shy;hā&shy;gata</span>?’—‘No, friend’.—‘What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard the <span lang='pi'>Tat&shy;hā&shy;gata</span> as one who is without form, without feeling, without perception, without volitional formations, without consciousness?’—‘No, friend’.—‘But, friend, when the <span lang='pi'>Tat&shy;hā&shy;gata</span> is not apprehended by you as real and actual in this very life (<span lang='pi'>diṭ&shy;ṭhe&shy;va dhamme saccato thetato anupalabbhiyamāno</span>), is it fitting for you to declare: “As I understand the dhamma taught by the Blessed one, a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death”?’</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-234"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;22.85<span class='scsegments'>:7.1–11.5</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-235">After Yamaka has understood Sāriputta’s teaching,<sup class="sesame">116</sup> we find the following exchange between them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-236">‘If, friend Yamaka, they were to ask you: “friend Yamaka, when a bhikkhu is an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>, one whose taints are destroyed, what happens to him with the breakup of the body, after death”?—being asked thus, what would you answer?’</p>
<p id="seg-237">‘If they were to ask me this, friend, I would answer thus: “friend, form is impermanent; what is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering has ceased (<span lang='pi'>niruddhaṁ</span>) and passed away (<span lang='pi'>atthagataṁ</span>). Feeling is impermanent; what is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering has ceased and passed away. Perception is impermanent; what is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering has ceased and passed away. Volitional formations are impermanent; what is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering has ceased and passed away. Consciousness is impermanent; what is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering has ceased and passed away”. Being asked thus, friend, I would answer in such a way’.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-238"><span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;22.85<span class='scsegments'>:13.1–13.16</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-239">This, then, is what really happens at the death of an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span>. Because human beings, including <span lang='pi'>ara&shy;hants</span>, are nothing more than an impersonal process (i.e. devoid of a stable self) which is impermanent and suffering, all that happens when an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> dies is that this process comes to an end. From the <span lang='pi'>ara&shy;hants</span>’ point of view the <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span> have nothing to do with them;<sup class="sesame">117</sup> nor are they anything apart from the <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>, as we have seen in the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn22.85" class="sesame">Yamaka Sutta</span>. Moreover, because the <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span> are suffering, their cessation can only be a good thing. The death of an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> is just the end, the cessation, of an unwanted process. Nothing of value is being lost; nothing is being annihilated.<sup class="sesame">118</sup> This is why the death of an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> <span data-custom-style="Emphasis"></span>does not count as annihilation. The reason an <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> is not annihilated at death has nothing to do with the nature of final Nibbāna.<sup class="sesame">119</sup></p>
<p id="seg-240">If the cessation of the <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span> is the full end of suffering and thus the highest possible happiness, then one would expect the attainment of the ‘cessation of perception and feeling’, <span lang='pi'>saññāvedayitanirodha</span>, to be the same. Indeed, this is exactly what one finds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-241">Should anyone say: ‘that [i.e. the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception] is the utmost pleasure (<span lang='pi'>sukhaṁ</span>) and joy (<span lang='pi'>somanassaṁ</span>) that beings experience’, I would not concede that to him. Why is that? Because there is another kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than that pleasure. And what is that other kind of pleasure? Here, Ānanda, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling. This is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.<sup class="sesame">120</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-242"><span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;59<span class='scsegments'>:15.1–15.6</span></span> &amp;<br>
<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;36.19<span class='scsegments'>:15.1–15.3</span></span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-243">This means that the full ending of everything is more ‘pleasurable’ and desirable than the blisses of even the most profound states of <span lang='pi'>samādhi</span>.<sup class="sesame">121</sup> In other words, complete cessation is superior and preferable to the highest bliss experienceable by human beings.</p>
<h1 id="seg-244">Conclusion</h1>
<p id="seg-245">The idea that final Nibbāna is nothing apart from the cessation of the <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span> might seem bleak. If it seems bleak, it is only due to the false sense of having a permanent self, or more precisely, because of the view of personal identity, <span lang='pi'>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</span>.<sup class="sesame">122</sup> The sense that one has a permanent core—a distortion of perception that is unavoidable for all <span lang='pi'>pu&shy;thuj&shy;janas</span>—makes cessation appear like annihilation and the successful practice of the path like a form of suicide. If cessation seems undesirable, it is only due to this distorted outlook.</p>
<p id="seg-246">Consider the following discussion between Ven. Sāriputta and Ven. Mahā-Koṭṭhita:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-247">[Mahā-Koṭṭhita:] ‘Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six spheres of sense contact (i.e. final Nibbāna), is there anything else? … is there not anything else?’ …</p>
<p id="seg-248">[Sāriputta:] ‘Speaking thus: “Friend, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of the six spheres of sense contact, is there anything else? … is there not anything else?”, one proliferates (<span lang='pi'>papañceti</span>) about that which is without proliferation (<span lang='pi'>appapañcaṁ</span>)’.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="tight-right-cite">
<p id="seg-249"><em>(transl. Brahmāli)</em><br>
<span class="sclinktext">AN&#8239;4.173</span></p>
</div>
<p id="seg-250">By asking ‘is there anything else?’ and ‘is there not anything else?’ the questioner reveals his distorted outlook, his preoccupation and concern about the fate of his non-existing self.<sup class="sesame">123</sup> This is why Sāriputta calls the questions <span lang='pi'>papañca</span>, ‘proliferation’, <span lang='pi'>papañca</span> being the distorted thinking process that arises from a distorted perception of reality.<sup class="sesame">124</sup> The <span lang='pi'>pu&shy;thuj&shy;jana</span> is trapped by <span lang='pi'>sakkāya</span><span data-custom-style="Emphasis">-</span><span lang='pi'>diṭṭhi</span>, by the perception of a permanent core in himself. But from his own point of view, whether he is aware of it or not, he is simply concerned with the destiny of what he sees as his own true essence.<sup class="sesame">125</sup></p>
<p id="seg-251">But if the illusion of personal identity is seen through, if the perceived solid core is seen not to exist, there is nothing to be concerned about any more.<sup class="sesame">126</sup> When it is seen that all a being is made up of are the ever-impermanent <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>, utterly tied up with suffering, then cessation becomes the most desirable thing possible. Questions such as ‘is there anything else?’ and ‘is there not anything else?’ are quite simply beside the point.<sup class="sesame">127</sup></p>
<p id="seg-252">In the final analysis, the Buddha’s teachings concern only the ending of suffering. Although it seems clear that ‘mere’ cessation is the correct interpretation of final Nibbāna and although there are obvious dangers in regarding final Nibbāna as ‘something’, ultimately it is irrelevant whether the state that supervenes when the <span lang='pi'>arahant</span> dies is ‘something’ or ‘nothing’. All that matters is that the five <span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>—that is, suffering—cease without remainder. Consider how the Buddha sometimes would summarise his teachings: ‘Good, good, Anurādha. Formerly, Anurādha, and also now, I make known just suffering and the cessation of suffering’ (<span class="sclinktext">SN&#8239;22.86<span class='scsegments'>:13.1–13.2</span></span>).<sup class="sesame">128</sup> And since suffering is coterminous with <span lang='pi'>saṁsāra</span>, it follows that ‘Nibbāna is the greatest bliss’ (<span class="sclinktext">MN&#8239;75<span class='scsegments'>:21.5</span></span> and <span class="sclinktext">Dhp&#8239;204</span>). What more can you ask for?</p>
