					<h2>Notes for What the Nikāyas Say and Do not Say about Nibbāna</h2>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="1">I have benefited from the kindness of Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi and Prof. Peter Harvey who both offered their careful comments and invaluable suggestions on a draft version of the present paper. Despite our disagreement on certain issues, the paper is considerably improved as a result of their generosity. My thanks are also due to a number of monks at Bodhinyana Monastery for their proofreading.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="2">I will provide references for these interpretations during the course of the paper.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="3">Most of the quotes found in this paper are taken from existing translations (see the bibliography at the end of this paper). Occasionally, where existing translations did not seem satisfactory, I have supplied my own. I have indicated all such instances. I have sometimes supplied Pali words and phrases for clarification.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="4">With the exception of most of the <em>Khuddaka-Nikāya</em>. I use the terms <em>suttas</em> and <em>Nikāyas</em> throughout this paper to refer to the four main <em>Nikāyas</em> of the Pali Canon, the <em>Vinaya-Piṭaka</em> and some of the works of the <em>Khuddaka-Nikāya</em>, specifically the <em>Udāna</em>, the <em>Itivuttaka</em>, the <em>Dhammapada</em> and the <em>Theragāthā</em>. I have also occasionally consulted parallel passages in the Chinese Buddhist Canon.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="5">See in particular SN IV 251 and SN IV 261, but cf. also SN IV 362–373, SN V 8, SN V 25–27 and AN I 158–159.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="6">This would thus include the actual event of becoming an <em>arahant</em>. As pointed out by Harvey 1995, 183, at SN IV 252 <em>arahant</em>-ship is explicitly defined as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion. This shows the close relationship between <em>Nibbāna</em> and <em>arahant</em>-ship in general. Harvey tries to show at some length that <em>Nibbāna</em> here refers to the event of attaining <em>arahant</em>-ship, not an aspect of the general state of <em>arahant</em>-ship. His first argument is that the Pali terminology points to an event rather than an ongoing reality. Without going into detail, it seems to me that the terminology is open to either interpretation, but most likely it refers to both. His second and main argument is based on the fact that <em>Nibbāna</em> is the end of <em>dukkha </em>whereas the <em>arahant</em> still has some <em>dukkha</em> remaining and thus the general state of <em>arahant</em>-ship cannot be called <em>Nibbāna</em>. But <em>Nibbāna</em> at <em>arahant</em>-ship is called <em>Nibbāna</em> ‘with residue remaining’ (It 38), the residue being the experience of ‘what is agreeable and disagreeable ... pleasure and pain (<em>dukkha</em>)’. It seems clear enough, therefore, that the presence of a residue of suffering does not bar the absence of lust, hatred and delusion in an <em>arahant</em> from being called <em>Nibbāna</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="7">The literal meaning of <em>Nibbāna</em> is ‘extinguishment’. (Alternatively, <em>Nibbāna</em> could perhaps be translated as ‘extinction’. However, ‘extinction’ has such negative connotations in english — connotations that obviously do not pertain to <em>Nibbāna</em> — that ‘extinguishment’ seems more appropriate). <em>Nibbāna</em> as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion is therefore simply the permanent extinguishing of these three defilements. In fact, <em>Nibbāna</em> is a relative term in the suttas, its precise connotation depending on what is being extinguished. At AN IV 454 each <em>jhāna</em> and each immaterial attainment is said to be ‘provisional <em>Nibbāna</em> (<em>nibbānaṃ ... pariyāyena</em>)’. ‘Non-provisional <em>Nibbāna</em>’ is reached at <em>arahant</em>-ship, and ‘final <em>Nibbāna</em>’ at the death of the <em>arahant</em> (see below). In each case something is extinguished (either temporarily or permanently): in first <em>jhāna</em> the five hindrances and the five senses are temporarily extinguished, in the second <em>jhāna vitakka-vicāra</em> etc.. At final <em>Nibbāna</em> all five aggregates are permanently extinguished.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="8">The <em>arahant’s</em> destruction of lust, hatred and delusion is unconditioned, since it is permanent. For this reason <em>Nibbāna</em> is also known as <em>asaṅkhata</em>, ‘not conditioned’.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="9">Note that my emphasis in this paper is not on final <em>Nibbāna</em> as the event of the death of the <em>arahant</em> but on that which happens beyond the <em>arahant’s</em> death.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="10">In fact, it seems difficult to find any unambiguous references apart from the one quoted here.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="11">That it is attainable by all <em>ariyas</em> is the commentarial interpretation. In contrast to this, a verse at AN I 133 seems to say that this <em>samādhi</em> — the perception in this <em>samādhi</em> is given as ‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is ... <em>Nibbāna</em>’, but it seems to be equivalent to the one quoted above — is attainable only by <em>arahants</em>, i.e. one who ‘has crossed over birth and old age’, <em>atāri so jātijaran ti</em>. Whatever the correct interpretation, the broader argument remains unaffected.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="12">For instance in the <em>Paramatthadīpanī-ṭīkā: ‘evaṃ suññatādināmaṃ nibbānaṃ ārammaṇaṃ katvā pavattāni maggaphalānipi ārammaṇavasenapi suññatādināmaṁ labhati</em>’, ‘Thus having made Nibbāna, which is called “emptiness” etc., the object, the resulting path and fruit obtain the name “emptiness” etc. on account of the object’. It is noteworthy that this statement is found in a modern (19th century) commentarial work. In his translation and explanation of the <em>Abhidhammattha Saṅgaha</em>, in which he refers extensively to the above mentioned <em>ṭīkā</em>, Bodhi (1993, 363) states that: ‘the attainment of fruition (<em>phalasamāpatti</em>) is a meditative attainment by which a noble disciple enters into supramundane absorption with <em>Nibbāna</em> as object’.
						<p>It is difficult to ascertain with any precision when the idea of <em>Nibbāna</em> as an object of consciousness first appears in Pali literature. It might be claimed that it appears already in the Canonical <em>Abhidhamma</em> where the <em>asaṅkhatadhātu</em> is included in the <em>dhammāyatana</em> (Vibh 72). However, the <em>asaṅkhatadhātu</em> is then defined in exactly the same way as in the <em>suttas</em>, namely, as the destruction of lust, hatred and delusion (Vibh 73). There is no indication that <em>Nibbāna</em> is an ‘existing entity’ which is taken as a direct object of consciousness. Exactly how the commentaries understand <em>Nibbāna</em> is also a moot point. I am not able to discuss this here, since it would be a major study in itself to trace the historical development of how <em>Nibbāna</em> is understood in Pali literature.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="13"><em>Nibbāna</em> cannot simply be classified as a mind object – with the corresponding consciousness being mind-consciousness – since all mind objects and their corresponding objects are said to be impermanent and suffering; see eg. SN IV 25. Indeed, the <em>Salāyatana-Saṁyutta</em> contains a large number of suttas that directly state that mental phenomena (<em>dhammas</em>) are suffering. These statements often have an almost equational quality. And there is no clear statement anywhere in the <em>suttas</em> that there are any exceptions to this. In fact the six senses together with their six objects are called ‘the all’ (SN IV 15), clearly indicating that there are no further senses or sense objects apart from these. These statements taken together make it impossible, to my mind, to accept the idea of <em>Nibbāna</em> as a mind object cognized by mind-consciousness. (The post-canonical literature, however, sometimes seems to take a different position, see e.g. the <em>Milindapañha</em>, p.270).</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="14">Deep states of <em>samādhi</em>, in particular the <em>jhānas</em>, consist of completely stable and uninterrupted perceptions, until one emerges.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="15">This interpretation hinges on understanding <em>bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ</em> to be an equational sentence: ‘the cessation of existence is <em>Nibbāna</em>’. On this reading, the expression is clearly an idea about <em>Nibbāna</em>, not a direct reference to it. If instead one were to translate this phrase as two words in apposition, ‘the cessation of existence, <em>Nibbāna</em>’, then this would be a direct reference to <em>Nibbāna</em> and one would have to conclude that the phrase concerns a direct perception of <em>Nibbāna</em>. There are other <em>suttas</em> (AN I 132-33, AN V 7-8 and three <em>suttas</em> at AN V 318-22), however, that speak of the same sort of <em>samādhi</em> but whose interpretation is unambiguous. In these <em>suttas</em> the relevant perception is given as ‘this is peaceful, this is sublime, that is ... <em>Nibbāna</em> (et<em>aṁ santaṁ, etaṁ paṇītaṁ, yad idaṁ ... nibbānan ti</em>)’. Here the wording is such — i.e. the verb ‘to be’ is required — that there can be no doubt that we are dealing with a sentence not just words in apposition. It seems quite clear, therefore, that this concerns a perception of an idea, an idea about <em>Nibbāna</em> — i.e. ‘this is peaceful, this is sublime’ — not a direct experience of <em>Nibbāna</em>. from this it is necessary to conclude that the expression <em>bhavanirodho nibbānaṁ</em> should also be understood as a sentence, not just two words in apposition.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="16">This is equivalent to what the commentaries call <em>phalasamāpatti/phalasamāpatti-samādhi</em>; see Mp V 2, 23 and Mp V 80, 14.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="17">‘Extinguishment’ being the literal meaning of <em>Nibbāna</em> (see footnote 7 above).</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="18">See Harvey 1995, 17–19 for a short survey of such attempts, followed by a critique of them. Other than Harvey’s references, there has also been the suggestion that the <em>anattā</em> doctrine is a strategy of spiritual development that is not meant as a metaphysical position on the existence of an <em>attā</em> (Ṭhānissaro, 1993).</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="19">The translation is based on Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation of a similar passage at SN II 25.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="20">See also Norman 1991, 207.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="21">This does not mean that one may cling to <em>Nibbāna</em>. The <em>puthujjana</em> by definition knows nothing but the five <em>khandhas</em>. Since he does not know what <em>Nibbāna</em> is he cannot possibly cling to it. (He could perhaps cling to some idea of <em>Nibbāna</em>, but such an idea would still be included within the five <em>khandhas</em>.) Once one becomes a stream-enterer, i.e. once one understands the <em>Dhamma</em>, one knows that the nature of <em>Nibbāna</em> is such that it cannot be clung to (see the last section of this paper).</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="22">There is no reason to see the denial here of ‘individual existence’ as implying the existence of a universal self or any other non-individual permanent entity.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="23">See in particular Harvey 1995, 198–214 and Johansson 1969, 111. Harvey does not in fact use the words ‘permanent consciousness’ in describing final <em>Nibbāna</em>. Instead, he says final <em>Nibbāna</em> is a ‘stopped discernment’ (Harvey 1995, 201; ‘discernment’ being Harvey’s translation of <em>viññāṇa</em>) or ‘consciousness beyond time’ (208). (He also argues that this ‘timeless’ <em>Nibbāna </em>can be periodically experienced by the <em>arahant</em> during life, 208). But the idea that <em>nirodha</em> can be understood as a ‘stopped state’ rather than just ‘cessation’ is not supported by the use of <em>nirodha</em> in the <em>Nikāyas</em>. Wherever its meaning is unambiguous it means ‘ending’, ‘cessation’; there is never any sense that it refers to a ‘state’. to make his point Harvey also employs the double meaning in English of the word ‘stopped’. For him a ‘stopped discernment’ is thus a consciousness that stands still, continuing without change, not a consciousness that has ended. In Pali, however, <em>nirodha/niruddha</em> has no such double meaning, it only means ‘stopped’ as in ‘ceased’ or ‘ended’.
					<p>As for Harvey’s use of the phrase ‘consciousness beyond time’, as opposed to ‘permanent consciousness’, it is difficult to see that it makes any difference. As a general tool of interpretation, it seems clear that the <em>Nikāyas</em> cannot possibly refute every single formulation that constitutes a contradiction to their outlook. In many cases, such as the present one, one has to make reasonable assumptions as to the implications of the <em>suttas</em>’ statements. As far as I can see, a consciousness beyond time would for all practical purposes be the same as a permanent consciousness, since it is change that gives rise to a perception of time. Moreover, since <em>Nibbāna</em> is specifically said to be <em>dhuva</em>, ‘stable’ (SN IV 370), which in the suttas is used as a synonym for <em>nicca</em>, ‘permanent’, the idea of ‘consciousness beyond time’ as opposed to ‘permanent consciousness’ seems to be a red herring. (Editor: though, beyond the <em>Nikāyas</em>, we see that <em>Dhammasaṅgaṇī</em> 1416 and <em>Milindapaṇha</em> 270 and 323 say that <em>Nibbāna</em> is neither past, present nor future. The meaning of this is a matter of debate.)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="24">See in particular the <em>Pañca Sutta</em> (which is identical to the <em>Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta</em>) at SN III 66–68. This does not mean that <em>Nibbāna</em> is a permanent self, since <em>Nibbāna</em> is not a ‘phenomenon’. See the last section of this paper for why this is so.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="25">Again, since <em>Nibbāna</em> is entirely different from consciousness (or any of the five <em>khandhas</em>), this does not mean that <em>Nibbāna</em> is not <em>anattā</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="26">Deep states of <em>samādhi</em> will be particularly attractive to grasp as a self because of their qualities of peace, stability, contentment, bliss, etc. If one has not heard or properly understood the Buddha’s teachings, it seems there will be an almost irresistible pull towards seeing these states as one’s true <em>attā</em>.
					<p>An interesting passage in this context is found at DN II 66–68. Here the Buddha asks the following semi-rhetorical question: ‘Where nothing at all is felt, could there be any sense of “I am” with reference to that (<em>tattha</em>)?’ (DN II 67, 19). From the subsequent conversation it is clear that the correct answer is ‘no’ and therefore that such a ‘state’ cannot be regarded as a self.</p>
					<p>Harvey (1995, 31) seems to interpret this to mean that if there is no experience of ‘I am’ at the time one abides in a particular state, i.e. that there is no self-awareness in that state, then that is sufficient to show that that state cannot be regarded as a permanent self. If this were correct, then any deep state of <em>samādhi</em>, during which there is no perception ‘I am’, could also not be taken as a self. Yet, as I have argued above, it is perfectly possible to regard such states as an <em>attā</em> once one emerges from them.</p>
					<p>But the passage at DN II 66–68 does not have to be interpreted as Harvey does. Its interpretation hinges on the import of the word <em>tattha</em>, which Harvey translates as ‘there’. But, as is implied in my translation above, <em>tattha</em> frequently has a ‘locative’ sense, meaning ‘in this case’, ‘about this’, ‘with reference to this’. If this is the intended meaning also in the present case, then the passage means there can be no sense of ‘I am’ <em>with reference</em> to that state. In other words, one is incapable of taking that state as a permanent self even after one emerges from it, which is precisely what one would expect of a ‘state’ where nothing at all is felt, where nothing at all is experienced.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="27">For ‘the underlying tendency to the view and conceit “I am” (<em>asmī ti diṭṭhimānānusayaṁ</em>)’, see MN I 47.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="28">This statement seems to be absolute. No allowance is made for a ‘stopped’ consciousness.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="29">In other words, at the very least feeling together with some sort of perception, no matter how subtle, would be the object of consciousness. Usually the situation would be much more complex, but feeling and perception would always be present with consciousness. I will discuss passages that may seem to refer to an ‘objectless consciousness’ in the section below on ‘unestablished consciousness’ and in the last part of this paper.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="30"><em>Nibbāna</em> is specifically said to be <em>dhuva</em> at SN IV 370, in direct contrast to how <em>viññāṇa</em> is described here. this seems to rule out any link between final <em>Nibbāna</em> and consciousness.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="31">It is hard to imagine a statement more explicit and clear than this one that a permanent consciousness does not exist. ‘There is no consciousness that is ... stable (<em>dhuva</em>)’ is again in direct contrast to the description of <em>Nibbāna</em> at SN IV 370.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="32">Again, pace Harvey, <em>nirodha</em> means ‘ceased’ in the <em>Nikāyas</em>. There is no place where it unambiguously refers to a (stopped) ‘state’.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="33">Johansson (1969, 77) suggests ‘gone to rest’ and ‘gone home’ as translations of <em>attham agamā</em>. But the only meaning in the <em>Nikāyas</em> of <em>attha-gam</em> and its cognate forms is ‘come to an end’. See in particular CPD which lists ‘disappear’, ‘cease’, ‘destroyed’, ‘gone out of existence’ and ‘annihilated’ and DP which adds ‘end’. (Though <em>attha-gam</em> is also used for the setting of the sun, the sun doesn’t ‘go home’ or ‘go to rest’; but it certainly ‘disappears’, at least temporarily. If there were any other clear cases where such metaphors were used of the sun, then perhaps ‘go home’ could be accepted as a rendering.)</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="34">This passage describes the final <em>Nibbāna</em> of the <em>arahant</em> Dabba Mallaputta.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="35">See references below.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="36">Harvey’s translation, ‘non-manifestive’, by which he means that nothing can ‘appear on or in’ this consciousness (1995, 206), in my opinion stretches the meaning of <em>anidassana</em> beyond what is reasonable. At the very least such a meaning would require a causative construction and probably something more involved (e.g. ‘the consciousness with which nothing else manifests’), not just the simple adjective. The straightforward meaning of <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> is that the consciousness itself is non-manifest.
					<p>Harvey supports his understanding by referring to a passage at MN I 127 where <em>anidassana</em>, together with <em>arūpī</em>, is used to describe space: no picture can be drawn ‘on’ space (<em>ākāsa</em>) since it is <em>anidassana</em> and <em>arūpī</em>. But one cannot deduce the exact meaning of <em>anidassana</em> simply by giving it the meaning best suited to the simile. If this were possible then <em>arūpī</em> would also mean ‘non-manifestive’ (in Harvey’s sense of the word), which it clearly does not. It also seems worth noting that this consciousness must be ‘non-manifest’ with reference to something; that is, it is a relative non-manifestation, not an absolute one. At the very least it is not non-manifest for the person who experiences it.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="37">For example in Harvey 1995, 199-201; Ñāṇamoli 2001, 1249; Johansson 1969, 76.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="38">Although the PTS version at DN I 223 has the reading <em>pahaṁ</em>, I understand the correct reading here to be <em>pabhaṁ</em>. The reading <em>pahaṁ</em> seems to be unique to the Sinhalese tradition and is explained by Norman (1992: 189) as likely ‘to be an error in the Sinhalese scribal tradition, where <em>ha</em> and <em>bha</em> are very similar and easily confused’. Moreover, the reading <em>pabhaṁ</em> also seems to be the basis for the Chinese version of this sutta, which has a reading meaning ‘shining’ (T I 102c17).</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="39">
						<p><em>Kattha āpo ca paṭhavī tejo vāyo na gādhati</em><br /><em>Kattha dīghañ ca rassañ ca aṇuṁ thūlaṁ subhāsubhaṁ,</em><br /><em>Kattha nāmañ ca rūpañ ca asesaṁ uparujjhatī ti </em></p>
						<p style="text-indent: 2em; margin:-1em"><em>Tatra veyyākaraṇaṁ bhavati:</em></p>
						<p><em>Viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ anantaṁ sabbato pabhaṁ</em><br /><em>Ettha āpo ca paṭhavī tejo vāyo na gādhati,</em><br /><em>Ettha dīghañ ca rassañ ca aṇuṁ thūlaṁ subhāsubhaṁ</em><br /><em>Ettha nāmañ ca rūpañ ca asesaṁ uparujjhati,</em><br /><em>Viññāṇassa nirodhena etth’etaṁ uparujjhatī ti.</em></p>
						<p>(My translation, based on Walshe 1995).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="40">Again, Harvey calls it a consciousness ‘beyond time’. However, as I have explained above, I cannot see how this in practice is distinguishable from a permanent consciousness. Moreover, <em>Nibbāna</em> is itself called <em>dhuva</em>, ‘permanent’. Harvey also argues that this consciousness can be attained by the <em>arahant</em> while he is still alive.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="41">Only two seemingly identical occurrences in the entire Pali Canon makes <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> a marginal concept. This in itself is a sufficient argument to set this expression aside and not allow it to affect our understanding of the relationship between <em>viññāṇa</em> and final <em>Nibbāna</em>.
					<p>Apart from its use with <em>viññāṇa</em>, <em>anidassana</em> is also found on its own, specifically at MN I 127, 36; DN III 217, 23 and SN IV 370, 12. In the last of these three, <em>anidassana</em> is used as a description of <em>Nibbāna</em>. But this does not mean that the word <em>anidassana</em> is equivalent to <em>Nibbāna</em>. Of the altogether 32 synonyms for <em>Nibbāna</em> found at SN IV 368–373, a large number are ordinary everyday words which are much more frequently encountered in contexts other than that of <em>Nibbāna</em>. In other words, just because <em>anidassana</em> is used as a synonym for <em>Nibbāna</em> at SN IV 370 does not in any way mean that it is not used with very different connotations elsewhere.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="42">See Warder 2001, viii and Bodhi 2000, 13. The following passage in Norman 1996, 157, commenting on the difficulty in translating Pali verse, is particularly instructive: ‘When John Brough, one of the greatest British Sanskrit scholars of this century [i.e. the 20th century], had just spent several years producing his study of the Gāndhārī Dharmapada, and had the whole of the <em>Dhammapada</em>-related literature at his fingertips, he was asked if he would produce a translation of the <em>Dhammapada</em> for the Pali text society. He replied: “I cannot. It is too difficult” ’.
					<p>It is not immediately clear whether the second passage quoted above, MN I 329, is verse or prose: MLDB treats it as verse but most Pali versions of the same passage seem to treat it as part of the prose. However, Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi informs me (private communication) that the passage at MN I 329 is in meter and therefore clearly verse.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="43">Moreover, both of the above passages are spoken to non-monastics (the householder Kevaddha and Baka the <em>brahmā</em>), neither of whom seems particularly well-versed in the Buddha’s teachings. Generally, at the time of the Buddha it was the monks and nuns who were the experts on the Buddhist doctrine. Most <em>suttas</em> spoken to lay Buddhists are simple and straightforward practical instructions. It seems quite possible, therefore, that the usage here of <em>anidassana</em> is simply evocative, not a precise reference to a specific state.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="44">i.e. ‘<em>viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ</em>’ in the present case.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="45">The first two immaterial attainments are known respectively as <em>ākāsānañcāyatana</em>, ‘the base of unlimited (<em>ananta</em>) space’, and <em>viññāṇañcāyatana</em>, ‘the base of unlimited (ananta) consciousness’ (e.g. at MN I 436).
					<p>Moreover, it seems that <em>ananta</em> is never used with mind or consciousness apart from describing states of <em>samādhi</em>. It never seems to be used to describe the ‘normal’ consciousness of the <em>arahant</em>, for example.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="46">This semantic closeness becomes particularly important with verse. due to metrical constraints, words which may have slightly different import in prose often become interchangeable in verse.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="47">E.g. with <em>kasiṇa</em> meditation at MN II 14, and with <em>samādhi</em> more generally at AN III 51.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="48">Of course, the mind without hindrances could also be a reference to the mind of the <em>arahant</em>, but <em>pabhassara</em> does not seem to be used in this sense. See for example SN V 92 and AN III 16.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="49">Of the three lines of the first verse, the first and the third line end with present tense indicative verbs. Thus we seem to have two separate sentences, each being a question. Moreover, while the Pali is ambiguous as to whether the response gives one or two answers, the parallel passage in the Chinese Canon (see below) seems to give two.
					<p>It might be objected that the lead-up to the verses at DN I 223 only contains one question. Why would the Buddha reformulate a single question into two? According to AN II 46 there are four ways of answering a question, one of which is using analysis. In the present case, the original question clearly has more than one answer (as will become clear below), and thus the Buddha’s reformulation may simply be a response to this fact.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="50">Note the ‘this’, <em>etaṁ</em>, in the last line of the answer verse. This would seem to refer back to <em>nāmañ ca rūpañ ca</em> of the previous line; that is, these lines are connected. Thus the last line cannot simply be regarded as an ‘add-on’ which does not refer to any of the questions in the question verse.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="51">Taking this verse in isolation, the most obvious candidate for this would be the immaterial attainments. But the use elsewhere of the phrase ‘where earth, water, fire and air find no footing’ (see in particular Ud 9 and SN I 33) indicates that it refers to something more profound than the immaterial attainments. It is perhaps a poetic way of expressing a full escape from saṁsāra. See also the discussion below.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="52">I take ‘long and short, small and great, fair and foul’ to be poetic examples of ‘name-and-form’ and thus to be included within name-and-form. In the <em>suttas</em> name-and-form is usually understood to encompass all phenomena apart from consciousness.
					<p>It is significant that the Chinese version of these verses (at T I 102c, 14–19) supports the above analysis. The question verse of the Chinese is virtually identical with the question verse of the Pali. (In both versions, this verse is the Buddha’s reformulation of the original single question into two questions.) The answer verse is as follows: ‘one should answer (應答): “Consciousness without form (識無形); infinite, self-illuminating (無量自有光); when this ceases then the four great [elements] cease (此滅四大滅);gross, subtle, beautiful, ugly cease (麤細好醜滅滅); therefore name-and-form cease (於此名色滅); consciousness ceases, remainder also ceases (識滅餘亦滅)”‘. Here it is quite clear that we have two answers. The first one is ‘consciousness without form, infinite, self-illuminating’. This would then be the answer to the first question about where the four elements cease or find no footing. Since the second line begins ‘when this ceases ...’, ‘this’ presumably referring back to the consciousness without form of the previous line (it is difficult to see what else it might refer to), this must be a second answer. This answer would correspond to the second question, concerning where name and form wholly cease. (Admittedly, the Chinese is a bit confusing here, since it starts the second answer with ‘then the four great elements cease’. I take this mention of the four great elements as simply an elaboration on some of the aspects of name-and-form.) Moreover, it is clear in the Chinese that the ‘consciousness without form’ cannot be a reference to <em>Nibbāna</em> since it ceases together with all other phenomena.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="53">If, on the other hand, ‘all’ is not to be regarded as equivalent to <em>saṁsāra</em> in its entirety, then <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> potentially becomes correspondingly broader. for example, if ‘all’ here instead only refers to everything within Baka the Brahmā’s knowledge (Baka the Brahmā being the Buddha’s interlocutor in the passage at M I 329), then <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> could be a reference to the immaterial attainments.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="54">This does not require this consciousness to exist ‘outside’ of <em>saṁsāra</em>. rather, it is a type of consciousness which is based on the full understanding of the <em>Dhamma</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="55">There are, in fact, good reasons for questioning whether this passage should be included in our analysis at all, since the reading in the above MN I 329 quote is very uncertain. According to the Burmese version of this verse (B<span class="superscript">e</span>: MN I 405), it is the Buddha who speaks it, referring to his own special understanding. However, according to the Sri Lankan (c<span class="superscript">e</span>:: MN I 770), the Thai (S<span class="superscript">e</span>:: MN I 596), and the PTS versions of this verse, it is spoken by Baka the Brahmā, referring to his special understanding (see Anālayo, forthcoming, footnote 162 to MN 49). This is obviously highly significant, because if this refers to Baka the Brahmā’s knowledge, then <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> must refer to a state of consciousness that he can access, i.e. most likely a <em>jhāna</em> state. This interpretation is further reinforced by the Chinese version of this <em>sutta</em>, also according to which it was Brahmā who spoke, see T I 548b, 11. (It is also significant that in the Chinese there is no equivalent of <em>anidassana</em>.) Given this uncertainty in the reading, it would be quite reasonable, maybe even preferable, to leave the passage at MN I 329 out of the present discussion. In spite of this, I have decided to incorporate the passage at M I 329 in my argument.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="56">This may also explain the usage of the term <em>anidassana</em>. According to our analysis, being accessible only to <em>ariyas</em>, <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> is ‘non-manifest’ (i.e. inaccessible) to all <em>puthujjanas</em>, including the devas of the very highest realms.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="57">This is the <em>samādhi</em> referred to at AN I 132–134, AN V 7–9, and AN V 318–326.
					<p>As mentioned in the introduction, and contrary to the view of some, I do not regard this consciousness as taking <em>Nibbāna</em> as its object. Rather, I see this as a <em>samādhi</em> gained through a particular perception that is based on the knowledge of what <em>Nibbāna</em> is.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="58">Nor would it refer to an <em>ariya’s</em> direct experience of <em>Nibbāna</em> during life: see my discussion of <em>ariya-samādhi</em> in the introduction.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="59">Harvey also sees this state of consciousness as experienceable by <em>arahants</em> during life, but different from their ordinary consciousness (1995, 201–203). Here, however, I will focus on the aspect of final <em>Nibbāna</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="60">I understand this passage to be another way of saying that consciousness is not attached to anything; it does not grasp at anything or take anything up. Because of being unestablished in this way, it does not get established in, i.e. commence, a new existence. That is, the passage concerns the cessation of the source of consciousness. Upon the attainment of <em>arahant</em>-ship, consciousness becomes devoid of the kind of desire that would otherwise have caused the future establishment of consciousness in a new rebirth. for the <em>arahant</em>, the source of consciousness has ceased, but consciousness itself only ceases when he dies.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="61">See the general discussion on consciousness above.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="62">The spelling <em>apatiṭṭhitaṁ</em> seems to be an error for <em>appatiṭṭhitaṁ</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="63">The expression ‘being unagitated, he personally attains <em>Nibbāna</em>’, is a common way in the <em>suttas</em> to describe <em>Nibbāna</em> in this life, i.e. the attainment of <em>arahant</em>-ship as opposed to final <em>Nibbāna</em>. See for instance MN III 244, where <em>Nibbāna</em> is described in similar terms, but final <em>Nibbāna</em> clearly happens later. Also note that in this case consciousness in fact becomes unestablished immediately prior to the attainment of <em>arahant</em>-ship. This strengthens the argument further.
					<p><em>Appatiṭṭhita</em> also recurs at Ud 80 where it seems to qualify a particular ‘state’ (of <em>samādhi</em>, perhaps) of the living <em>arahant</em>. Since it concerns an <em>arahant</em>, his consciousness is by definition <em>appatiṭṭhita</em>, ‘unestablished’, as discussed above. for further discussion of Ud 80 see section on <em>Nibbāna</em> below.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="64">Johansson (1969, 131) states that ‘The new, transformed state of <em>citta</em> is <em>Nibbāna</em> ...’ He then claims that this <em>citta</em> continues after the death of the <em>arahant</em>: ‘But when an <em>Arahant</em> dies ... the “stillness” and “emptiness” of the <em>citta</em> makes it survive, free and anonymous ...’ (133). Johansson evidently takes a particular state of <em>citta</em> as equivalent to final <em>Nibbāna</em>.
					<p>A similar position seems to be taken in Mahā Boowa (1980, 23): ‘the <em>citta</em> by its very nature is <em>amataṁ</em> - Undying ...’; ‘Once <em>paññā</em> has totally shattered and cleared the <em>kilesas</em> away, the <em>citta</em> will be transformed into the state of purity ... How can it vanish? ... this one is the genuine <em>amataṁ</em> (the Undying). Immortal by way of purity ... This is the real and true substance or essence which is in the midst of our <em>khandha</em>’ (45); ‘The <em>kilesas</em> can’t destroy the <em>citta</em> ... This nature is unassailable, absolute and permanent. It cannot be annihilated’ (76). It must be kept in mind, however, that the teachings given by Thai meditation teachers are often difficult to interpret. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, the idiom of Thai meditation teachers, particularly those associated with the Thai forest tradition, is notoriously idiosyncratic. They rarely use the expressions and words found in the <em>Nikāyas</em>, and if they do, they sometimes give these expressions new meanings. Secondly, the language they use is often not very precise, at least compared with that of the <em>suttas</em>, and thus there are significant problems of interpretation. Thus it is possible that Ven. Ajahn Mahā Boowa may be referring to something other than the English translation appears to show. Still, the translation as it stands is hard to square with the descriptions of <em>Nibbāna</em> and <em>citta</em> in the <em>suttas</em>.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="65">In the <em>Vinaya-Piṭaka</em> the Buddha typically asks a monk who thinks he may have committed an offense, <em>kiṁcitto</em>, ‘what (was your) intention?’, e.g. at Vin III 116, 23. <em>Citta</em> seems to mean ‘thought’ in the standard description of thought-reading, e.g. at DN I 214. for a further sense of the wide use of the term citta see PED.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="66">cf. CDB, 769, n.154.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="67">The use of <em>citta</em> here, in place of <em>viññāṇa</em>, could perhaps be under the influence of the <em>abhidhamma</em>. see Ven. Anālayo’s study of the Anupada Sutta, MN 111, in Anālayo forthcoming.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="68">‘<em>Citta</em>’ which is usually translated as ‘mind’ is here translated as ‘thought’ because ‘mind’ does not really fit the context. Perhaps ‘mental state’ would be a better translation.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="69">It seems clear that <em>citta</em> is often regarded as including other mental factors apart from <em>viññāṇa</em>. See discussion above.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="70">In both this quote and the one below the singular ‘<em>yaṁ ca kho etaṁ/idaṁ</em>’, ‘and that/this which’, is used. Thus ‘<em>citta</em>’, ‘<em>mano</em>’, and ‘<em>viññāṇa</em>’ refer to the same entity. Also note that Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi here has translated ‘<em>itipi</em>’ with ‘and’, a translation normally used for ‘<em>ca</em>’. A more literal translation of ‘<em>itipi</em>’ might be ‘also’ or ‘too’: ‘But, bhikkhus, as to that which is called mind, also mentality, also consciousness’. It is significant that this phrase is also found in the Chinese and the Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit versions of this <em>sutta</em>, cf. respectively T II 81c, 7 and <em>Tripāṭhī</em>, folio 5 V3.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="71">Apparently the Tibetan counterpart to this sutta has the equivalent phrase; cf. Weller, 1934: 26.
					<p>MN138 provides another striking example of <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>citta</em> being used interchangeably. In the summary at the beginning of the <em>sutta</em>, at MN III 223, 10+12, <em>viññāṇa</em> is used. Later on in the same sutta, in the section explaining this <em>viññāṇa</em>, <em>citta</em> is used in its place; see MN III 226, 9f and MN III 227, 1f. Further, in the explanation itself, <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>citta</em> are used together.</p>
					<p>For further references to the interchangeability of <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>citta</em> in non-Pali Buddhist texts (i.e. primarily Chinese and Sanskrit sources), see Anālayo forthcoming, footnote 168 to MN 138.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="72">This passage refers to a wrong view.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="73">Although I have argued in the above section concerning <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> that the interpretation of verse is often difficult, this becomes particularly relevant if a verse is interpreted in a way that is contrary to what can be established from canonical prose passages alone. In the present case, the verses merely reinforce what can be established elsewhere.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="74">The translation is based on the alternative reading ‘<em>vimariyādikataṁ</em>’ in the last line.
					<p>Norman’s translation of ‘<em>vidhamissati</em>’, ‘will blow away’, can probably be improved upon. other possible translations include: ‘will be demolished’ (cf. CDB, p.985), ‘will be ruined’, ‘will fall away’, and ‘will be destroyed’.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="75">See also Anālayo 2003: 191, n.39.
					<p>My understanding is that the radiance is always available, it is only matter of overcoming the hindrances. But when the defilements are present the mind is not radiant: otherwise we would be able to observe that radiance, since the mind can only be known through direct experience.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="76">Whether the other <em>ariyas</em> would know of such a <em>citta</em> seems unclear. See my discussion of <em>ariya-samādhi</em> in the introduction.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="77">Following Harvey’s approach, one might alternatively call this a ‘timeless (mode of) mind’. I have already discussed why the idea of ‘timelessness’, in my opinion, does not add anything new. See discussion of <em>viññāṇa</em> above.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="78">Moreover, consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>) is also occasionally said to be ‘freed’; see in particular SN III 53 and 55, above. If ‘mind’ has a distinct meaning in the phrase ‘the mind is liberated’, then the same would have to be true for <em>viññāṇa</em> in this parallel construction. But we have already seen that the Buddha rejects the idea of <em>viññāṇa</em> as a permanent entity.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="79">See for example the <em>asaṅkhata-saṁyutta</em> (SN IV 359–373) where there are 32 synonyms for <em>Nibbāna</em>, none of which is <em>citta</em> or any particular state of <em>citta</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="80">As with <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>citta</em>, <em>mano</em> and <em>citta</em> have their own more or less distinct spheres of usage in the <em>suttas</em>. Sometimes in the analysis of mental processes the Buddha uses <em>mano</em> to describe the mind in relation to mind-consciousness but not in relation to the other five types of consciousness. In this analysis, <em>mano</em> is the sense through which mind-consciousness arises. <em>Citta</em>, on the other hand, apparently encompasses all six types of consciousness. outside such technical usage, however, <em>mano</em> and <em>citta</em> seem to be used synonymously.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="81">This passage concerns mind reading.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="82">Both <em>mano</em> and <em>citta</em> are usually translated as ‘mind’. When the words are used together in the suttas, translators often seem to struggle to find a second english word that also means ‘mind’ (cf. CDB, 769, n.154).
					<p>The following two examples are also instructive of the close relationship between <em>citta</em> and <em>mano</em>:</p>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‘A mind of ill-will (<em>vyāpanna-citto</em>), mental intention of hate (<em>paduṭṭha-mana-saṅkappo</em>)’. (SN III 93, my translation)</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
					<p>‘An undaunted mind (<em>apatitthīna-citto</em>), a non-dejected mind (<em>adīna-mānaso</em>), a mind without ill-will (<em>avyāpanna-cetaso</em>)’. (SN V 74 but cf. CDB, 1904, n.69; my translation)</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>In the above <em>mano</em> and <em>citta</em>, as well as <em>ceto</em>, seem to be used as synonyms.</p>
					<p>Yet another example of this close relationship is the use of <em>kāya</em> (body), <em>vācā</em> (speech), and <em>mano</em> (mind) to denote the three doors of wholesome and unwholesome actions; occasionally the three doors are denoted as <em>kāya</em>, <em>vācā</em>, and <em>citta</em>; cf. SN II 231, SN II 271 and SN IV 112. See also Dhp 348 where one finds <em>vimutta-mānaso</em> in place of the standard <em>ceto-vimutti</em>.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="83">That is, the cessation of the five aggregates. This does not imply anything except the cessation of an entirely impersonal process. This is very different from the annihilation of a permanent entity. See discussion below.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="84">I use quotes here and below to emphasize that such a ‘state’, or ‘existing entity’, would be completely different from anything that can normally be experienced by human beings. Thus the word ‘state’ is only used for lack of suitable terminology.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="85">Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu (1993, 4) also seems to support the idea that final <em>Nibbāna</em> is more than mere cessation: ‘As for the question of how <em>nibbana</em> is experienced after death, the Buddha says that there is no limit in that experience by which it could be described’. Note in particular the words ‘that experience’, referring to <em>Nibbāna</em> after the death of the <em>arahant</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="86">Or it may be called <em>asaṅkhatadhātu</em>, see MN III 63, 13, or <em>amatadhātu</em>, see AN III 356,14.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="87">It also ignores the distinction between <em>Nibbāna</em> and final <em>Nibbāna</em>. From the definition of <em>Nibbāna-dhātu</em> at SN V 8, see below, it seems clear that it refers to the state of <em>arahant</em>-ship, not final <em>Nibbāna</em>.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="88">That is, property in the sense of quality.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="89">The point of these expressions is presumably simply to point out that there are such things as cessation and renunciation.</div>
					<div class="booknote" data-note="90">That is, the extinguishment of the defilements of lust, hatred and delusion.
					<p>Moreover, <em>dhātu</em> is used for <em>saññāvedayitanirodha</em>, the cessation of perception and feeling (SN II 150). In this case it can clearly not refer to an element as something existing. rather, it seems to refer to the existence of the possibility of the cessation of the mental <em>khandhas</em>.</p>
					<p>The word <em>pada</em>, lit. ‘foot’, has a similarly broad application. For example, the expression <em>amataṁ padaṁ</em> (e.g. at AN II 51, 29), which is used as a synonym for <em>Nibbāna</em>, might perhaps be rendered ‘the characteristic of freedom from death’; see PED. (See discussion of Ud 80 below (second <em>sutta</em>) for why <em>amataṁ</em> is better rendered as ‘freedom from death’ than ‘the deathless’. See also CPD.)</p>

	<div class="book" id="thebook" data-shortcode="niknib">
		<h1 id="TOCTarget0-1">Preface</h1>
		<p>The only way of moving towards consensus on the controversial subject of the nature of <em>Nibbāna</em><sup>1</sup> is by appealing to the sole source of authority common to practically all Buddhists: the <em>Nikāyas</em>/<em>Āgamas</em>. In the present paper I will first give an overview of the usage of the term <em>Nibbāna</em> in the <em>Nikāyas</em>. I will then argue that, according to the <em>Nikāyas</em>, <em>Nibbāna</em> cannot be regarded as a self. Next, I will point out that the <em>Nikāyas</em> do not see <em>Nibbāna</em> as a form of consciousness, including such exceptional kinds of consciousness as <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> and <em>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</em>. Nor can <em>Nibbāna</em> be regarded as equivalent to mind, or any particular state of mind. In the final section I aim to show that the most reasonable interpretation of the <em>Nikāyas</em> is that final <em>Nibbāna</em> is no more than the cessation of the five khandhas.</p>
		
		<h1 id="TOCTarget1">Introduction</h1>
		<p><em>Nibbāna</em> is the goal of Buddhist practice. As such it is only natural that there is great interest in understanding what it might mean to achieve it. At the same time, <em>Nibbāna</em> is the most profound of Buddhist concepts. It is perhaps not surprising then that the concept of <em>Nibbāna</em> has given rise to a large number of interpretations, some based on meditative experience and others on scriptural study and ‘logical’ deduction, and that many of them are mutually contradictory.<sup>2</sup></p>
		<p>Given this confusing situation, the purpose of the present paper is to try to pin down what the Buddha himself meant by <em>Nibbāna</em>. The only satisfactory way of achieving this is to turn to the <em>suttas</em>, for it is the <em>suttas</em> that are the final arbiter in any <em>Dhamma</em> dispute:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Suppose a monk were to say: ‘... this is the <em>dhamma</em>, this is the discipline (<em>vinayo</em>), this is the Master’s teaching’, then, monks, you should neither approve nor disapprove his words. Then, without approving or disapproving, his words and expressions should be carefully noted and compared with the <em>suttas</em> and reviewed in light of the discipline. If they, on such comparison and review, are found not to conform to the <em>suttas</em> or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is not the word of the Buddha, it has been wrongly understood by this monk’, and the matter is to be rejected. But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the <em>suttas</em> or the discipline, the conclusion must be: ‘Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha, it has been rightly understood by this monk. (<span class="sclinktext">DN 16:4.8.1–4.8.13</span>)<sup>3</sup></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>In the following discussion on the nature of <em>Nibbāna</em> I will therefore base my argument, as far as possible, on the complete contents of the <em>Nikāyas</em>.<sup>4</sup> More specifically, I will inquire into the relationship between <em>attā</em>, <em>viññāṇa</em> and <em>citta</em> on the one hand and <em>Nibbāna</em> on the other. An understanding of this relationship, as I intend to show, is critical for a proper understanding of <em>Nibbāna</em>. In the final section of this paper, I will discuss <em>Nibbāna</em> itself in greater detail. But to prepare the ground for the ensuing discussion, it is necessary first of all to take a preliminary look at how the <em>suttas</em> employ the term <em>Nibbāna</em>.</p>
