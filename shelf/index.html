					<h2>Welcome</h2>
					<p><strong>theMettāShelf</strong> is a repository for Buddhist Books, with a built in app for reading ebooks and listening to AudioBooks.</p>
					<p>Currently this app is in it's infancy and we consider it a prototype. There will be many design changes over the coming years as we try out functionality. If you have any ideas, please feel free to contact us, either via the contact form on the main site (see below) or you can message the librarian <strong><a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net/u/stu/summary">@stu</a></strong> on the SuttaCentral forum.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="infocontainer">
					<h2>Instructions</h2>
					<p>To read a book, simply click on it.</p>
					<p>To get back to this, the library page, click on the Library logo in the top left hand corner of any book.</p>
					<p>For settings click the cog wheel in the top right. Once you are in a book, there are additional settings available.</p>
					<p>All settings and your place in each book is stored on the device that you are using. No information is sent to Wisdom & Wonders.</p>
					<p>You can search for a book on this page using the 'FIND' menu on the left hand side of this page.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="infocontainer">
					<h2>Resources</h2>
					<p>There is a complete list of <strong><a href="https://wiswo.org/bookdownloads/">all ebook downloads</a></strong> on our main site, including non-English language books, not in this app.</p>
					<p>If you have any problems, comments or suggestions for future versions, please visit our <strong><a href="https://wiswo.org/contact/">contacts page</a></strong> on our main site.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Searches on the <strong>Sutta Number</strong> will return books that reference that sutta in their pages.</li> 
							<li>We use SuttaCentral style numbering. e.g. try <strong>an4.170</strong> or <strong>mn66</strong></li> 
							<li>We are currently indexing the books in the library where they reference sutta's. <span style="color:crimson;">Only the shorter booklets have been indexed so far.</span></li> 
							<li><strong>Hint:</strong> To see which books have currently been indexed, press the Sutta Number button and leave the search field blank. </li>
							<li>As soon as you start your search, all books will disappear beacuse <strong>you must enter the exact number of the sutta</strong> that you are looking for. For example, <strong>an4.17</strong> will not return a book where only <strong>an4.170</strong> is referenced.</li>

						<p><span class="bookshelfauthor">Ajahn Brahmali</span> gives an overview of the usage of the term <em>Nibbāna</em> in the <em>Nikāyas</em>. He argues that, according to the <em>Nikāyas</em>, <em>Nibbāna</em> cannot be regarded as a self; that the <em>Nikāyas</em> do not see <em>Nibbāna</em> as a form of consciousness, including such exceptional kinds of consciousness as <em>anidassana viññāṇa</em> and <em>appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa</em>; nor can <em>Nibbāna</em> be regarded as equivalent to mind, or any particular state of mind. He aims to show that the most reasonable interpretation of the <em>Nikāyas</em> is that final <em>Nibbāna</em> is no more than the cessation of the five <em>khandhas</em>.</P>

						<h3 class="bookshelftitle">The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts</h3>
						<p><span class="bookshelfauthor">Bhikkhu Sujato and Bhikkhu Brahmali</span></p>
						<p>This work articulates and defends a single thesis: that the Early Buddhist Texts originated in the lifetime of the Buddha or a little later, because they were, in the main, spoken by the Buddha and his contemporary disciples. This is the most simple, natural, and reasonable explanation for the evidence.</p>
						<p>Our argument covers two main areas:</p>
						<ol>
						<li>The grounds for distinguishing the Early Buddhist Texts (EBTs) from later Buddhist literature;
						</li>
						<li>The evidence that the EBTs stem from close to the Buddha’s lifetime, and that they were generally spoken by the historical Buddha.
						</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Most academic scholars of Early Buddhism cautiously affirm that it is possible that the EBTs contain some authentic sayings of the Buddha. We contend that this drastically understates the evidence. A sympathetic assessment of relevant evidence shows that it is <em> very likely </em> that the bulk of the sayings in the EBTs that are attributed to the Buddha were actually spoken by him. It is <em> very unlikely </em> that most of these sayings are inauthentic.</p>

						<h3 class="bookshelftitle">Viññāṇa Anidassana</h3>
						<p><span class="bookshelfauthor">Bhikkhu Sunyo</span></p>
						<p>A wide range of opinions has long surrounded two innocent Pali words: <em>viññāṇa anidassana</em>. They are translated variously, as ‘consciousness that is without feature / signless / invisible / non-manifesting / makes no showing / can not be characterized’, et cetera. This variety already indicates that their meaning is somewhat obscure. This obscurity has, however, not stopped interpreters from giving the words a lot of importance, because some see in <em>viññāṇa anidassana</em> a kind of consciousness essentially equal to nibbāna. But there are many problems with this. Bhikkhu Sunyo examines these problems and discusses why <em>viññāṇa anidassana</em> is not nibbāna, but rather it is the state of boundless consciousness, the second “formless” meditation state.</p>

						<p><span class="bookshelfauthor">Ajahn Brahmali</span> investigates the relationship between mindfulness and stillness. </p>
						<p>One of the most common unquestioned assumptions among Buddhist meditators is that <em>satipaṭṭhāna </em>is synonymous with <em>vipassanā</em>. This assumption, it seems, often is a result of reading the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas in isolation without carefully considering the context in which <em>satipaṭṭhāna </em>is used throughout the <em>suttas</em>. When the broader view of the entire Sutta Piṭaka is taken into account, it becomes clear that such an assumption is, at best, only partially correct. In this short study I will investigate the various contexts in which <em>satipaṭṭhāna </em>appear and in particular consider its relationship with <em>samādhi</em>.</p>

						<p>This work is an attempt to clarify the meaning and function of <em>samatha</em> (tranquility) and <em>vipassanā</em> (insight) in Buddhist meditation. Much has been written on this topic, yet a cloud of confusion persists. Though modern Buddhism claims to rest on a foundation of inquiry, many meditators seem willing to invest their spiritual trust in meditation techniques without carefully considering exactly what it is they are practicing.</p>
						<p>This is not a beginner’s introduction nor a guide to the nuts and bolts of practice. It is intended for those who have some knowledge and experience in Buddhist meditation, but who are confused by the diverse and often conflicting opinions expressed by meditation teachers. All of those teachers, however, are unanimous on one point—the greatest Teacher, the Teacher of teachers, is the Buddha himself. We wish to follow the path of the Buddha, so our starting point should be to see what the Buddha himself said, and did not say, about meditation. Even though the main aim <span class="pageno" data-page="1"></span>here is theoretical clarity, I hope to offer inspiration and practical tools for meditation as well.</p>

						<p><q>Meditation is the way to achieve letting go. In meditation one lets go of the complex world outside in order to reach the serene world inside. In all types of mysticism and in many traditions, this is known as the path to the pure and powerful mind. The experience of this pure mind, released from the world, is very wonderful and blissful.</q></p>

						<h3 class="bookshelftitle">Dependent Origination</h3>
						<p>In this essay <span class="bookshelfauthor">Ajahn Brahm</span> discusses the meaning of the twelve factors that make up the standard description of dependent origination. He analyses the nature of the causes linking each pair of neighbouring factors, using a Western model of causality. Having explained what the Buddha meant by dependent origination, he then examines perhaps the most interesting question: Why did the Buddha place such importance on dependent origination? What is its purpose? In the final section, Ajahn proposes that the function of dependent origination is threefold:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>To explain how there can be rebirth without a soul.</li>
							<li>To answer the question “What is life?”</li>
							<li>To understand why there is suffering, and where suffering comes to an end.</li>

						<p><span class="bookshelfauthor">Ajahn Brahmali</span></p>
						<p><q>Ajahn Brahmāli gives a concise explanation of dependent origination that, in my view, extracts its core principle while remaining faithful to the original intent. A major point that Ajahn Brahmāli makes, both explicitly and through his mode of explanation, is the integral connection of dependent origination with the teaching of rebirth. It has become fashionable today to interpret dependent origination simply as an affirmation of the interdependence and interconnectedness of all events, and then to extol it as a forerunner of the scientific method. But while dependent origination may well point to interdependence and a scheme of universal interconnections, this is not its primary purpose. The primary purpose, as seen in the most archaic Buddhist texts, is to show the causal origination of suffering, which is sustained precisely by our bondage to rebirth. Thus, by revealing the conditions that keep us bound to repeated birth, dependent origination also indicates what must be done to gain liberation.</q></p>

						<p>From the preface:</p>
						<p>The purpose of this book is to analyze the textual sources of 20th century Theravāda meditation theory. The focus is on the prime source works for what I call the <em>vipassanāvāda</em>, the ‘vipassanā-doctrine’. This is a special interpretation of some central meditation concepts that has become the <em>de facto</em> orthodoxy in Theravāda Buddhism, although not without controversy. The term <em>vipassanāvāda</em> is useful in that the Pali suffix -<em>vāda</em> points to the importance of the <em>theory</em> on which the practices are based. More than that, the same suffix comes to mean not just a doctrine, but also the school that follows the doctrine. This is all too appropriate in the current case, since ‘vipassanā’ has come, rather strangely, to be used as if it refers to an actual school of Buddhism (rather than an aspect of meditation cultivated in all schools).</p>

						<p><span class="bookshelfauthor">Ajahn Chatchai</span> gives precise instructions on the cultivation of loving-kindness.</p> 
						<p class="center"><q>Like a lotus at dawn which slowly unfurls its petals to the warmth of the sun, our mind, while spreading mettā, is soft, gentle and joyful.</q></p>
						<p class="center"><q>Mettā is love that never demands that things have to be certain ways before they are embraced.</q></p>
						<p class="center"><q>When you have difficulty in maintaining awareness or when sati (mindfulness) takes a day off, you just need to add a bit of softness into whatever you are doing.</q></p>
						<p class="center"><q>We sit to be aware. Whether we will gain samādhi or not is not the issue. We don’t have expectations. What we should do is to be aware of our body that is sitting meditation. This is a state of mind with sati.</q></p>
						<p class="center"><q>The softness of the heart can sometimes be stunningly powerful as if it would overtake our whole body.</q></p>
						<p class="center"><q>Whenever your mind becomes gentle and kind even for one minute, that minute is worth our existence.</q></p>
