<h1 id="seg-1">Introduction</h1>
<p id="seg-2">One of the most common unquestioned assumptions among Buddhist meditators is that <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is synonymous with <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;pas&shy;sanā</span>. This assumption, it seems, often is a result of reading the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas<sup class="sesame">1</sup> in isolation without carefully considering the context in which <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is used throughout the <span lang="pi">suttas</span>. When the broader view of the entire <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:sutta" class="sesame">Sutta Piṭaka</span> is taken into account, it becomes clear that such an assumption is, at best, only partially correct.<sup class="sesame">2</sup> In this short study I will investigate the various contexts in which <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> appear and in particular consider its relationship with <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>.<sup class="sesame">3</sup></p>
<h1 id="seg-3">Samādhi and the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas</h1>
<p id="seg-4">The Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas are often understood as being only concerned with <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;pas&shy;sanā</span> meditation. But there is nothing intrinsic to the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas that allows one to conclude thus. Indeed, there are several aspects of these <span lang="pi">suttas</span> that point to <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> also being concerned with <span lang="pi">samatha</span> and <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>, calm and stillness.</p>
<p id="seg-5">The first of these aspects is the inclusion of the first tetrad of the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn118" class="sesame">Ānāpānasati Sutta</span> in the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas.</p>
<p id="seg-6"><span lang='pi'>Ān&shy;āp&shy;āna&shy;sa&shy;ti</span> is usually regarded as a <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> practice, and there seems to be no reason why it should be regarded otherwise here.<sup class="sesame">4</sup> Moreover, the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn118" class="sesame">Ānāpānasati Sutta</span> states that each of its four tetrads fulfils each of the four <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;nas</span>.<sup class="sesame">5</sup> It then concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-7">“Bhikkhus, that is how mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, fulfils the four <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;nas</span>.”<sup class="sesame">6</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="seg-8">And it is not only the <span lang='pi'>ān&shy;āp&shy;āna&shy;sa&shy;ti</span> part of the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas which relates to <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>. The cemetery contemplations, for example, are elsewhere specifically said to be <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> practices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-9">“And, monks, what is the effort of guarding? Here, monks, a monk guards a favourable object of <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> which is present in him: the perception of a skeleton, the perception of a worm-infested corpse, the perception of a livid corpse, the perception of a festering corpse, the perception of a fissured corpse, the perception of a bloated corpse.”<sup class="sesame">7</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="seg-10">Indeed, it seems that all the <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> practices have a <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> aspect. Take the standard passage which concludes each exercise of the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-11">“In this way he contemplates an aspect of the body internally, or he contemplates an aspect of the body externally, or he contemplates an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … phenomena internally and externally.”<sup class="sesame">8</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="seg-12">Then consider the following passage which relates the internal contemplation directly to <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-13">“Here a monk contemplates an aspect of the body internally, energetic, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed desire and aversion for the world. Contemplating an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … phenomena internally, he is rightly stilled (<span lang="pi">sammā</span> <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;mā&shy;dhi&shy;ya&shy;ti</span>), rightly purified.”<sup class="sesame">9</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="seg-14">Satipaṭṭhāna and Samādhi Outside of the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas</h1>
<p id="seg-15">The above should be sufficient to at least suggest that <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> is an integral part of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span>. However, to be able to make a strong case for this relationship, and to consider in more detail what it involves, it is necessary to look beyond the Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas to the broader use of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> in the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:sutta" class="sesame">Sutta Piṭaka</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-16">In the threefold division of the Buddhist Path, into <span lang="pi">sīla</span> (virtue), <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>, and <span lang="pi">paññā</span> (wisdom), <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is classified under <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>, not under <span lang="pi">paññā</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-17">“Right effort, right mindfulness (<span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span>),<sup class="sesame">10</sup> and right <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> (the <span lang="pi">jhānas</span>)<sup class="sesame">11</sup>—these states are included in the category of <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>. Right view and right intention—these qualities are included in the category of wisdom.”<sup class="sesame">12</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="seg-18">If <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> were equivalent or closely related to <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;pas&shy;sanā</span> rather than <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>, would it not be included in the category of wisdom rather than the category of <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>?<sup class="sesame">13</sup></p>
<p id="seg-19">The most important relationship between <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> and <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> that emerges from a broad reading of the <span lang="pi">suttas</span> is that the practice of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> leads to <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>:<sup class="sesame">14</sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-20">“The four <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;nas</span> are the bases of <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>.”<sup class="sesame">15</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-21">“The repetition, development, and cultivation of these same qualities (<span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> and right effort) is the development of <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>.”<sup class="sesame">16</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-22">“ ‘I will contemplate an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … phenomena,<sup class="sesame">17</sup> energetic, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed desire and aversion for the world.’ It is in this way, monk, that you should train.</p>
<p id="seg-23">“When, monk, this <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> has been developed and made much of in this way, you should develop this <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> with initial and sustained application, you should develop it without initial application but with a remainder of sustained application, you should develop it without initial and sustained application, you should develop it with rapture, you should develop it with comfort, you should develop it with equanimity.”<sup class="sesame">18</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="seg-24">The last part, “initial and sustained application ... with equanimity,” is a reference to the <span lang="pi">jhānas</span>.<sup class="sesame">19</sup> Note how <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> practice is first called “this <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>” and then said to lead on to the <span lang="pi">jhānas</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-25">“So too, monks, here some foolish, incompetent, unskilful monk contemplates an aspect of the body, energetic, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed desire and aversion for the world. While he contemplates an aspect of the body, his mind does not become stilled (<span lang='pi'>sa&shy;mā&shy;dhi&shy;ya&shy;ti</span>) ...</p>
<p id="seg-26">“So too, monks, here some wise, competent, skilful monk contemplates an aspect of the body, energetic, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed desire and aversion for the world. While he contemplates an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … phenomena, his mind becomes stilled (<span lang='pi'>sa&shy;mā&shy;dhi&shy;ya&shy;ti</span>)…</p>
<p id="seg-27">“That wise, competent, skilful monk gains pleasant dwellings in this very life, and he gains mindfulness and clear comprehension.”<sup class="sesame">20</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="seg-28">The phrase “pleasant dwellings in this very life” is a common synonym in the <span lang="pi">suttas</span> for the four <span lang="pi">jhānas</span>.<sup class="sesame">21</sup></p>
<p id="seg-29">Thus a pattern emerges whereby the four <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;nas</span> constitute the practice and development of <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>, eventually leading to the four <span lang="pi">jhānas</span>, <span lang='pi'>sam&shy;mā&shy;samā&shy;dhi</span>. This relationship between the <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;nas</span> and <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> is in fact made very explicit in the <span lang="pi">suttas</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-30">“It is indeed to be expected, venerable sir, that a noble disciple who has faith, energy, and mindfulness, will gain <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>, will gain one-pointedness of mind, when he has created a foundation through relinquishment. That <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> of his, venerable sir, is his faculty of <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>.”<sup class="sesame">22</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-31">“For one of right mindfulness (<span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span>), <span lang='pi'>sam&shy;mā&shy;samā&shy;dhi</span> (the <span lang="pi">jhānas</span>) springs up.”<sup class="sesame">23</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="seg-32">Satipaṭṭhāna and Vipassanā</h1>
<p id="seg-33">The above survey presents the most important evidence on the context in which <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> occurs throughout the <span lang="pi">suttas</span>. Having thus shown that the usual purpose of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is the attainment of <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>, it is necessary to consider the relationship between <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> and <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;pas&shy;sanā</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-34">Firstly, it should be noted that the prevalence of a direct link between <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> and <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> does not necessarily mean that <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is all about <span lang="pi">samatha</span> meditation. Rather, it means that, whether one practices <span lang="pi">samatha</span> or <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;pas&shy;sanā</span>, in both cases the purpose of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is the attainment of <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-35">Secondly, the question arises as to what happens after <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>: is there such a thing as post-<span lang="pi">samādhi</span> <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span>, and if so, what does it involve? In this context it is important to note that a number of <span lang="pi">suttas</span> make it clear that <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> practice can take one all the way to the end of the Buddhist Path, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-36">“Bhikkhus, these four <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;nas</span>, when developed and cultivated, are noble and liberating; they lead one who acts upon them to the complete destruction of suffering.”<sup class="sesame">24</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="seg-37">For <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> to be able to take one to full awakening, it seems required that it must include post-<span lang="pi">samādhi</span> <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;pas&shy;sanā</span>, i.e. deep insight.<sup class="sesame">25</sup> But a direct relationship between <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> and <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;pas&shy;sanā</span> is never explicitly mentioned in the <span lang="pi">suttas</span>.<sup class="sesame">26</sup> To establish such a link it is necessary to broaden the inquiry to include other terms that also signify insight, such as <span lang="pi">ñāṇa</span>, <span lang="pi">dassana</span>, and <span lang="pi">yathā</span>-<span lang="pi">bhūta</span>-<span lang="pi">ñāṇa</span>-<span lang="pi">dassana</span>. This broadened inquiry brings to light the following interesting passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-38">“Come, friends, contemplate an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … phenomena, energetic, clearly comprehending, unified, serene, stilled, with one-pointed mind, in order to know the body according to reality (<span lang="pi">yathā</span>-<span lang="pi">bhūta</span>-<span lang="pi">ñāṇa</span>).”<span id='note-27' class="anchor"></span><sup class="sesame">27</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="seg-39">Note how this passage differs significantly from the standard <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> formula found almost everywhere else. It is two differences in particular that are important in the context of this study: Firstly, the insight aspect relates to the deep insights of seeing reality as it actually is (<span lang="pi">yathā</span>-<span lang="pi">bhūta</span>-<span lang="pi">ñāṇa</span>); secondly, using a string of related terms—unified, serene, stilled, with one-pointed mind—the passage puts a strong emphasis on <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>. The implication is that <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> should be practiced for the purpose of deep insight only after <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> has been achieved.<span id='note-28' class="anchor"></span><sup class="sesame">28</sup> It thus seems clear that there is such a thing as post-<span lang="pi">samādhi</span> <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> and that its purpose is deep insight.<sup class="sesame">29</sup></p>
<h1 id="seg-40">Two Stages of Satipaṭṭhāna</h1>
<p id="seg-41">From the above it emerges that <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> normally should be considered as a practice leading to <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> and under special circumstances as a practice leading to deep insight. Furthermore, it appears that these two aspects of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> can be divided into two quite distinct stages. In accordance with the natural progression of meditation practice,<sup class="sesame">30</sup> the first stage of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is about attaining <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>. Once <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> has been achieved (i.e. the necessary condition for deep insight is in place), the mind is equipped to uncover the true nature of the five aspects of personality<sup class="sesame">31</sup> and realise the successive stages of awakening. This is the second stage of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span>. Such a two-stage division of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is in fact explicitly described in the <span lang="pi">suttas</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-42">“... so these four focuses of mindfulness (<span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span>) are the bindings for the mind of the noble disciple in order to subdue his habits from lay life, to subdue his distress, fatigue, and fever from lay life, and in order that he may attain the true way and realise extinguishment (<span lang="pi">nibbāna</span>).</p>
<p id="seg-43">“Then the Tathāgata trains him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, contemplate an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … phenomena, but do not think thoughts of sense desire.’ ”<sup class="sesame">32</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="seg-44">Here the first stage of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> serves the purpose of abandoning refined hindrances.<sup class="sesame">33</sup> This is part of the path leading to <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>. The second stage of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is here characterised by sense desire having been abandoned, something suggesting that <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> has been attained.<sup class="sesame">34</sup></p>
<h1 id="seg-45">Conclusion</h1>
<p id="seg-46">Almost all <span lang="pi">sutta</span> passages that deal with the place of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> in the broader scheme of the Buddhist path, show that <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is a condition for <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>. It must therefore be concluded that the main purpose of <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is to bring the mind to <span lang="pi">samādhi</span>. This result is important because it contradicts the common misunderstanding that <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> is only concerned with <span lang='pi'>vi&shy;pas&shy;sanā</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-47">The second important conclusion that can be drawn from the above discussion is that <span lang='pi'>sa&shy;ti&shy;paṭ&shy;ṭhā&shy;na</span> as a deep insight practice, leading to insight into the true nature of the aspects of personality (<span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>), only begins after <span lang="pi">samādhi</span> has been attained. This conclusion is in line with a common theme in the <span lang="pi">suttas</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
