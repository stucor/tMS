<h1 id="seg-1">Introduction</h1>
<p id="seg-2">A wide range of opinions has long surrounded two innocent Pali words: <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span>. They are translated variously, as ‘consciousness that is without feature / signless / invisible / non-manifesting / makes no showing / can not be characterized’, et cetera. This variety already indicates that their meaning is somewhat obscure. This obscurity has, however, not stopped interpreters from giving the words a lot of importance, because some see in <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> a kind of consciousness essentially equal to nibbāna.<sup class="sesame">1</sup> But there are many problems with this, starting with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p id="seg-3">No sutta equates nibbāna to any type of consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-4">Many suttas do the exact opposite: they relate nibbāna to the cessation of consciousness,<sup class="sesame">2</sup> and equate consciousness to suffering.<sup class="sesame">3</sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-5">There are only two mentions of <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> in <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:sutta" class="sesame">the Pali suttas, and other early suttas</span> don’t have the concept at all. This makes the words not only difficult to interpret, but also unlikely to be a core teaching on such a central topic as nibbāna.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="seg-6">Some things are just best explained in writing—hence this essay. I show here that <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> is not nibbāna, but a poetic description of the state of boundless consciousness, the second “formless” meditation state. Most of the arguments were made before by others.<sup class="sesame">4</sup> I gathered them here, together with a few thoughts of my own.</p>
<p id="seg-7">This essay analyzes rare terms in abstract texts. However, it also illustrates the nature of Pali verse, and provides a good example of how to apply the Buddha’s advice on deciding what his real teachings were.</p>
<p id="seg-8">For accessibility I have mostly adopted common translations for Pali words—such as ‘form’ for <span lang="pi">rūpa</span>—even though these may not be my personal preferences.</p>
<h1 id="seg-9"><span class="chapnum"> 1</span><br>The Kevaddha Sutta</h1>
<p id="seg-10">As stated, the suttas mention <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> twice: once in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha (With Kevaddha) Sutta</span>,<sup class="sesame">5</sup> and once in the Brahmanimantanika (Invitation of a Brahmā) Sutta.<sup class="sesame">6</sup> We will look at them separately.</p>
<p id="seg-11">In the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span> the Buddha tells a layman named Kevaddha a story of an unnamed monk who ascends various heavens searching for an answer to a question. This monk’s strategy is, to put it mildly, somewhat unusual. Monks ordinarily brought their questions directly to the Buddha or one of his close disciples. The story seems to be symbolic, the monk’s astral travels being a metaphor for looking for enlightenment in the wrong place. The story probably parodies brahmin ideas, because the gods, including <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span>, all failed to answer the monk’s question.</p>
<p id="seg-12">To put a long story short: After visiting higher and higher heavens while never finding an answer, the monk ends up asking Brahmā his question: “Where do the four elements—earth, water, fire, and air—cease without remnant?” He essentially wants to know where form (<span lang="pi">rūpa</span>) ceases, because according to the ideas of the time “all form of whatever kind is the four elements”.<sup class="sesame">7</sup> <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> does not know the answer, so he sends the monk to the Buddha, who, when asked the same question, says it should be rephrased. He changes the question from “where do earth, water, fire, and air [i.e. form] cease without remnant?” to “where do earth, water, fire, and air<em> find no footing</em>?” (This change is quite significant, as we’ll see later.) The Buddha then also adds a second question, asking where not only <span lang="pi">rūpa</span>, but <span lang="pi">nāma</span> ceases too. (<span lang="pi">Nāma</span>, literally ‘name’, in this context means something like ‘personal characteristics’. It stands for the immaterial aspects of an individual being, excluding consciousness. I will leave it untranslated.)</p>
<p id="seg-13">The Buddha presents the two questions in a six-line verse, and then answers those questions in two separate verses:</p>

<p id="seg-16">For that the explanation is:</p>

<p id="seg-19">(A similar structure of multiple questions and answers exists in the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:snp" class="sesame">Sutta Nipata</span>.)<sup class="sesame">9</sup></p>
<hr style='border:0; margin-top: 0; height:0em'>
<p id="seg-20">But now comes the crux of the matter. Some interpret the two answer verses to contain one single answer—somewhat like this:</p>
<blockquote><div class='line-block'><p class="OAstart" id="seg-21"><span class="list-margin">[A]</span>“Boundless consciousness,<br>invisible, fully shining:<br>here earth, water,<br>fire, and air find no footing,<br>here the long and short,<br>the small and gross, the fair and ugly—<br>here <span lang="pi">nāma</span> and form<br>fully come to cease:<br>when consciousness ceases,<br>then those come to cease.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p id="seg-22">This tiny change in punctuation—removing a period—turns it all into quite a riddle. Boundless consciousness now seems to be equal to the cessation of <span lang="pi">nāma</span> and form, and therefore (if we also ignore the last two lines) to nibbāna.</p>
<p id="seg-23">The underlying problem is that the original Pali manuscripts do not have punctuation such as periods and question marks. Translators have to add these themselves, and it is not always obvious where to do so. In this case the various lines starting with the word ‘here’ can easily confuse. It may even be that the transition between the two answers is somewhat vague on purpose. The Buddha could be saying something like: “I got a lot of money … stolen from me!” The meaning only becomes clear when you come to the end, to the cessation of consciousness. This is a poetical device if anything, and we are talking about poems here.</p>
<p id="seg-24">Either way, there are various more concrete reasons to divide the answer verses into two:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p id="seg-25">All translators seem to recognize there are two sentences in the question verse, because it has two main verbs: ‘find a footing’ and ‘come to cease’. But many seem to miss that these two verbs ask very different things. ‘To find no footing’ means something very different than ‘to cease’. This is exactly why the Buddha made the change in the monk’s original question! So, there being two distinct questions, there should be two distinct answers too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-26">The first answer ends with a main verb (<span lang="pi">gādhati</span> ‘find footing’), which in Pali commonly indicates the end of a sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-27">Sentences only rarely run from one verse to the next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-28">The first answer verse mentions the existence of a type of consciousness (boundless consciousness), the second the cessation of consciousness. These opposites are not both part of the same answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-29">Most importantly, when seen as two separate answers, the verses become standard teachings found throughout the suttas, not unique ones found only here (which they would be if <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> were nibbāna).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="seg-30">The rest of this section clarifies this last statement in detail. But first it is important to emphasize that the questions and answers are all <em>verse</em>. Pali verse always needs to fit a certain pattern called ‘meter’. To be able to comply to this meter, verses are very free in their use of words. They often depart from convention or even literal accuracy, using what is known as poetic licence. In the analysis of verse these matters should always be taken into account.</p>
<h2 id="seg-31">The first question</h2>
<p id="seg-32">Let me isolate the first question and answer:</p>
<blockquote><div class='line-block'><p class="OAstart" id="seg-33"><span class="list-margin">[Q1]</span>“Where do earth, water,<br>fire, and air find no footing?”</p></div><div class='line-block'><p class="OAstart" id="seg-34"><span class="list-margin">[A1]</span>“Boundless consciousness,<br>invisible, fully shining:<br>here earth, water,<br>fire, and air find no footing.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p id="seg-35">Remember, the question essentially asks, “where does <em>form</em> find no footing?” The answer—“boundless consciousness, invisible, fully shining”—refers to the state of boundless consciousness, the second so-called formless state of meditation, also known as ‘the base of infinite consciousness’, or sometimes called ‘the sixth jhāna’. This is evident from the words ‘boundless’ (<span lang="pi">ananta</span>) and ‘consciousness’ (<span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span>). Not only do these make up the very name of the state of boundless consciousness, they also describe its attainment in the common formula, “focusing on ‘boundless consciousness’, one attains the state of boundless consciousness.”<sup class="sesame">10</sup> The state of boundless consciousness is the only context in the suttas which uses the words ‘boundless’ and ‘consciousness’ together. It also occurs very frequently, so we should naturally assume the Buddha is referring to it here. Otherwise, if he would for example refer to nibbāna, he introduces here a teaching which is totally unique, in obscure verse, in just five words, out of which two would be easily mistaken as something else (namely the state of boundless consciousness).</p>
<p id="seg-36">In Pali the five words making up the answer are:</p>
<blockquote><div class='line-block'><p id="seg-37"><span lang='pi'>viñ&shy;ñā&shy;ṇaṁ</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sanaṁ</span> (consciousness invisible)<br><span lang="pi">anantaṁ</span> <span lang="pi">sabbato</span> <span lang="pi">pabhaṁ</span> (boundless fully shining)</p></div></blockquote>
<p id="seg-38">These words seem to be forced into their particular order by the meter of the verse, which requires eight syllables in each line. As A.K. Warder, a leading scholar of Pali verse, wrote: “Poetic licence is most noticeable in the freedom of word order in verse.”<sup class="sesame">11</sup> This means ‘boundless’ can be taken as the central adjective describing ‘consciousness’, with ‘invisible’ and ‘fully shining’ being secondary to it. That is to say, the latter two apply not to ‘consciousness’, but to ‘boundless consciousness’ as a whole. It is not consciousness that is fully shining and invisible, it is <em>boundless consciousness</em> that is. I rearranged the words in my translation to clarify this. (Such rearrangement, let it be clear, is done often in translations of Pali.)</p>
<p id="seg-39">The term ‘fully shining’ (<span lang="pi">sabbato</span> <span lang="pi">pabhaṁ</span>) is a metaphor, of course. The state of boundless consciousness does not literally give off light. It refers to the absence of the five mental hindrances in deep meditation. As the <span data-sesame-key="an-blurbs:an5.23" class="sesame">Upakkilesa (Impurities) Sutta</span> in the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:an" class="sesame">Aṅguttara Nikāya</span> says: “when the mind is freed from these five impurities [i.e. hindrances] it is <em>shining</em>.”<sup class="sesame">12</sup> The suttas often compare a mind in deep meditation to something that gives off light, most commonly a fire.<sup class="sesame">13</sup></p>
<p id="seg-40">Aside from the hindrances, another thing that is notably absent in the state of boundless consciousness is perceptions pertaining to ‘form’<sup class="sesame">14</sup> (which I understand to be a subtle mental perception, not a perception of the body). This is addressed by <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span>, translated here quite literally as ‘invisible’. Since the meaning of <span lang="pi">rūpa</span> includes ‘appearance’,<sup class="sesame">15</sup> <span lang="pi">arūpa</span> means ‘without appearance’, thus ‘invisible’. This translation is in accordance with the apparent meaning of <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn33" class="sesame">Saṅgīti Sutta</span>, which mentions visible form and invisible form (i.e. material form and the more subtle types such as in meditation).<sup class="sesame">16</sup> The only other text that gives a useful context for <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> is the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn21" class="sesame">Kakacūpama Sutta</span>, which says one can not paint the sky because “the sky is without form, invisible” (<span lang="pi">ākāso</span> <span lang="pi">arūpī</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sano</span>).<sup class="sesame">17</sup> Here we see <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> indeed as a synonym of <span lang="pi">arūpa</span>.<sup class="sesame">18</sup></p>
<p id="seg-41">We should not need to look for a deeper meaning behind <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span>, because, as accurately stated by Warder again, in verse “the need to fit the sentence to the meter influences the choice of vocabulary, so that unusual synonyms and rare words may be used.”<sup class="sesame">19</sup> <span lang='pi'>Ani&shy;das&shy;san&shy;aṁ</span> fits this perfectly: it is a rare and unusual synonym which supplies the meter <span lang="pi">arūpaṁ</span> and <span lang="pi">anantaṁ</span> could not. In summary, all it does is metaphorically describe the absence of form in the state of boundless consciousness, the second formless state.</p>
<p id="seg-42">Let's return to the question, “where does form find no footing?” Why is the answer the second formless state and not the first? This is because form can still “find a footing” in the first formless state, the state of boundless space. According to Sariputta in the <span data-sesame-key="an-blurbs:an9.34" class="sesame">Nibbānasukha Sutta</span>, a perception pertaining to form can infiltrate this state and bring the mind back to the fourth jhāna: “After the complete transcendence of perceptions of forms, […] focusing on boundless space, a monk attains the state of boundless space. If in that state he begins to perceive or focus back on forms, that will be an affliction to him.”<sup class="sesame">20</sup> The state of boundless consciousness is the lowest meditative state which can not be directly disturbed by such perceptions, and therefore it is “where form finds no footing”.</p>
<p id="seg-43">The state of boundless consciousness is still just a temporary escape from form, however, which explains why the Buddha changed the monk's question from “where do earth, water, fire, and air [i.e. form] <em>cease without remnant</em>?”, which implies permanent cessation, to “where do earth, water, fire, and air <em>find no footing</em>?”, which only implies a temporary inability to infiltrate. This change in the question can not be explained if the boundless consciousness of the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span> were to be a permanent escape from form, like nibbāna.</p>
<p id="seg-44">As a sidenote, two other Pali suttas contain verses with the phrase “where earth, water, fire, and air find no footing”<sup class="sesame">21</sup> and one has a similar line in an inspired utterance, which is technically prose, but is still very poetical.<sup class="sesame">22</sup> These three suttas all refer to the cessation of the aggregates (<span lang='pi'>khan&shy;dhas</span>) after the death of an enlightened one, often called parinibbāna.<sup class="sesame">23</sup> This does not pose any problems for the ideas laid out above, because form not only finds no footing in the state of boundless consciousness, but after parinibbāna finds no footing anywhere either. In other words: “where earth, water, fire, and air find no footing” is just a partial description of parinibbāna that also applies to the state of boundless consciousness. Just because it refers to parinibbāna in these suttas, does not mean it also does in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>. A line of verse can describe one thing in one context, and another thing in another context. This is quite common in the suttas. An example is found right here in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>. The line “the long and short, the small and gross, the fair and ugly”, which has such a deep meaning here, elsewhere simply refers to things one should not steal.<sup class="sesame">24</sup></p>
<h2 id="seg-45">The second question</h2>
<p id="seg-46">Here are the second question and answer again:</p>
<blockquote><div class='line-block'><p class="OAstart" id="seg-47"><span class="list-margin">[Q2]</span>“Where do the long and short,<br>the small and gross, the fair and ugly—<br>where do <span lang="pi">nāma</span> and form<br>fully come to cease?”</p></div><div class='line-block'><p class="OAstart" id="seg-48"><span class="list-margin">[A2]</span>“Here the long and short,<br>the small and gross, the fair and ugly—<br>here <span lang="pi">nāma</span> and form<br>fully come to cease:<br>when consciousness ceases,<br>then those come to cease.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p id="seg-49">Remember that this question was not originally asked by the monk, but was added by the Buddha. The Buddha did so to indicate the monk’s quest for the cessation of form did not reach far enough. The formless, included in <span lang="pi">nāma</span>, must cease as well.</p>
<p id="seg-50">The answer reflects a teaching found at least a hundred times elsewhere in the Pali Canon: “when consciousness ceases, <span lang="pi">nāma</span> and form will cease”—a stock phrase of Dependent Arising.<sup class="sesame">25</sup> So here too, just as with the first question, the Buddha rephrases a teaching his audience would have been familiar with.</p>
<p id="seg-51">We find the same teaching in the <span data-sesame-key="snp-blurbs:snp5.2" class="sesame">Ajita’s Question Sutta</span> in the <span data-sesame-key="snp-blurbs:snp-parayanavagga" class="sesame">Pārāyana Vagga</span>:<sup class="sesame">26</sup></p>
<blockquote><div class='line-block'><p class="OAstart" id="seg-52"><span class="list-margin"></span>“As to where <span lang="pi">nāma</span> and form<br>fully come to cease:<br>when consciousness ceases,<br>then those come to cease.”</p></div></blockquote>
<p id="seg-53">This verse is virtually identical to the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>. Yet the <span data-sesame-key="snp-blurbs:snp5.2" class="sesame">Ajita’s Question Sutta</span> makes no mention of <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> or anything alike. The verse stands on its own as a complete teaching. This confirms that in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span> “where <span lang="pi">nāma</span> and form fully come to cease” is only connected to the cessation of consciousness, not to <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-54">Now nearing the end of <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>, we can assume the astral-traveling monk of the story understood the Buddha’s teachings, since after the verses nothing else is asked. And after being told the story, Kevaddha also asks no further. Throughout the suttas the Buddha is repeatedly asked to explain short statements he made, so the fact that neither the monk nor Kevaddha asked for an explanation, indicates that the verses included no concepts that were new to them. They contained standard teachings. And this is how verse always works in the canon: it gives summaries, in florid language that’s meant to inspire rather than inform. It does not introduce unique and elevated teachings, especially not on something as central to the Buddha’s thought as nibbāna.</p>
<p id="seg-55">The monk and Kevaddha may have only understood things on a theoretical level, though, because neither is said to have gained any noteworthy insights afterwards. This can be taken as another indication that these verses contain nothing special. If they contained a unique, deep teaching, we could expect it to be received with a bang. But instead we are treated with an anticlimax: Kevaddha was just “happy with what the Buddha said”. Compare this for example with the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn35.28" class="sesame">Fire Discourse</span>,<sup class="sesame">27</sup> where a thousand monks are said to have become enlightened. And all this text says about consciousness is that “it is burning”.</p>
<p id="seg-56">For completeness, here are some more technicalities concerning the second question and answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p id="seg-57">The phrase “long, short, small and gross, and fair and ugly” is obviously poetical, even in English. Elsewhere the exact same phrase refers to what should not be stolen,<sup class="sesame">28</sup> so it seems to simply mean ‘everything’. This makes contextual sense, since when consciousness and <span lang='pi'>nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span> cease, all suffering ceases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-58">The word <span lang='pi'>ni&shy;ruj&shy;jha&shy;ti</span> (‘cease’) of the monk’s original question is not adopted by the Buddha in his second question, but changed for the synonymous <span lang='pi'>up&shy;ar&shy;uj&shy;jha&shy;ti</span> (‘come to cease’). This is another instance of adjusting to the meter. <span lang='pi'>Upa&shy;ruj&shy;jha&shy;ti</span> is one syllable longer, making the line the required eight syllables long. A change of prefix (in this case <span lang="pi">upa</span>- for <span lang="pi">ni</span>-) to make a word fit the meter is common. As Warder states: “[In verse] a prefix may be dropped or added where the meaning of the sentence will tolerate a slight change of nuance.”<sup class="sesame">29</sup> <span lang='pi'>Upa&shy;ruj&shy;jha&shy;ti</span> is almost exclusively used in verse, supporting this case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-59">Contrary to what others have argued, <span lang='pi'>up&shy;ar&shy;uj&shy;jha&shy;ti</span> is simply a synonym of <span lang='pi'>ni&shy;ruj&shy;jha&shy;ti</span>, and it does not mean ‘hold in check’ or something alike. This is clear from all other contexts the word is used in. To give one example: “They who understand suffering, the origin of suffering, and where suffering totally, fully comes to cease (<span lang='pi'>up&shy;ar&shy;uj&shy;jha&shy;ti</span>) […]”<sup class="sesame">30</sup> Here <span lang='pi'>up&shy;ar&shy;uj&shy;jha&shy;ti</span> of course refers to <span lang="pi">dukkha</span>-<span lang="pi">nirodha</span>, the <em>cessation</em> of suffering, not its “holding in check”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-60">The word ‘here’ (<span lang="pi">ettha</span>) can mean ‘here’ in the widest sense of the word: ‘at this place’, ‘in this state’, ‘at this time’, or ‘in this case’. The latter two are applicable here, since the ceasing of consciousness is not a place but an event.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="seg-61">On a more speculative note, the search for the cessation of form is reminiscent of certain ideas found in Brahmanism. Put briefly, some brahmins thought that by shedding their own form they could merge with the <em>Brahman</em>, the universal consciousness.<sup class="sesame">31</sup> This may explain why the Buddha tells Kevaddha a story wherein he shows his knowledge to be superior to Brahmā (who brahmins took as the highest manifestation of <em>Brahman</em>), while specifically mentioning the cessation of consciousness. Interestingly, the brahmin texts, the <span data-sesame-key="wp:Upanishads" class="sesame">Upaniṣads</span>, also describe <em>Brahman</em> as ‘boundless’.<sup class="sesame">32</sup></p>
<p id="seg-62">To summarize, the verses of the Kevaddha Sutta poetically rephrase two teachings encountered throughout the suttas: (1) the state of boundless consciousness and (2) the cessation of consciousness along with <span lang='pi'>nā&shy;ma&shy;rū&shy;pa</span>.</p>
<h1 id="seg-63"><span class="chapnum"> 2</span><br>The Brahmanimantanika Sutta</h1>
<p id="seg-64">The only other occurrence of <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> is found in the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn49" class="sesame">Brahmanimantanika Sutta</span>,<sup class="sesame">33</sup> which portrays a discussion between the Buddha and <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Brahmā Baka</span>. Here too, just like in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>, the Buddha shows his knowledge to be superior to a <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> god. The passage we are concerned with is abstract and not easy to translate. It says something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="seg-65">“Boundless consciousness, invisible, fully shining: that is outside the solidity of earth, outside the wetness of water, the heat of fire, the movement of air, the being of beings, the godhood of the gods, the Creator-hood of the Creator, the Brahmāhood of Brahmā, the Streaming Radiance of [the Gods of] Streaming Radiance, the Refulgent Glory of [the Gods of] Refulgent Glory, the Great Fruit of [the Gods of] Great Fruit, the Overlordship of the Overlord, and outside the allness of all.”<sup class="sesame">34</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="seg-66">Given the clarity of the phrase in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>, it would make sense for “boundless consciousness, invisible, fully shining” to refer the state of boundless consciousness here too. The four elements and the various worlds mentioned are indeed all part of the realm of forms, existing outside of this formless state.<sup class="sesame">35</sup> “The allness of all” poses a problem, though, as it can be interpreted to include the formless, and thus the state of boundless consciousness itself. But there are some ways to reconcile this.</p>
<p id="seg-67">First option. Although ‘all’ (<span lang="pi">sabba</span>) elsewhere occasionally refers to the six senses,<sup class="sesame">36</sup> this does not have to be the case here. ‘All’ is an indefinite word which (in both English and Pali) does not have a single fixed meaning. Here ‘all’ could just refer to the four elements and all the heavenly worlds mentioned before it, which together make up all the form realms. Considering how detailed the enumeration of these worlds is, we could expect a similar enumeration for the formless realms, if these were also included in ‘all’. That this does not happen suggests that ‘all’ here only means all the form realms.</p>
<p id="seg-68">The second option relies on the fact that the different Pali versions disagree on who spoke the words quoted above. Only the Burmese edition attributes them to the Buddha; the Thai, Sri Lankan and PTS editions all attribute them to <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Brahmā Baka</span>.<sup class="sesame">37</sup> Moreover, the Burmese version is broken, missing an <span lang="pi">iti</span> (end quote marker) after the passage, which is needed to give the word back to <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Baka</span>. So it too does not fully attribute boundless consciousness to the Buddha. In the Chinese parallel in the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:ma" class="sesame">Madhyama Āgama</span> the exchange is very different, but it also has Baka making a claim to be “conscious of boundless elements”, not the Buddha.<sup class="sesame">38</sup></p>
<p id="seg-69">Some translators follow the majority of editions and attribute the lines to <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Baka</span>,<sup class="sesame">39</sup> while others follow the unique Burmese edition and attribute them to the Buddha.<sup class="sesame">40</sup> The latter might do so because the Buddha spoke the same lines in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>, but there is no reason why <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Baka</span> could not have spoken them here. Lines of verse continually reoccur throughout the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:sutta" class="sesame">Nikāyas</span>, being spoken by different people. Adopting verses of others seems to have been a common practice of the time.</p>
<p id="seg-70">There are also some good contextual reasons to attribute the words to <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Baka</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p id="seg-71">When there is a change of speaker in the suttas, the new speaker always addresses the other by name or title. They say for example “Sir Gotama”, “Great King”, or “Venerable”. Throughout this sutta the Buddha continually addresses Baka as “Brahmā”, but the quote above lacks such an address. This indicates the speaker has not changed, and Baka is still speaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-72">The sutta begins with <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Baka</span> claiming “this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal … and beyond this there is no other escape.” According to the commentary this refers to Baka’s heaven realm.<sup class="sesame">41</sup> However, this is not all that clear from the sutta itself (which is likely why the commentator felt a need to comment). I take Baka to instead refer to <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span>, which he mistakes to be permanent, outside “the allness of all”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-73">After the words are spoken, <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Baka</span> tries to vanish. This seems a random act, unless we translate <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> as ‘invisible’ and attribute it to Baka. By attempting to vanish (which he fails to do) he might try to show off his attainment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="seg-74">Just like in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>, the Buddha here too ends the conversation by alluding to cessation. He says: “I have seen existence will come to an end, so do not welcome any type of existence.”<sup class="sesame">42</sup> Here “any type of existence” includes any type of consciousness, but the Buddha, trying to teach <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Baka</span> a lesson, was referring especially to boundless consciousness. Moreover, if “boundless consciousness” was already the Buddha’s highest teaching on nibbāna, this statement on the cessation of existence would be very much out of place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="seg-75">To summarize these points, Bhikkhu Anālayo wrote: “A coherent reading of the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn49" class="sesame">Brahmanimantanika Sutta</span> is possible with the same reference [to boundless consciousness] being attributed to <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Baka Brahmā</span>.”<sup class="sesame">43</sup></p>
<p id="seg-76">A third option is that neither the Buddha nor Baka ever spoke these words. After all, the suttas are not a flawless record of facts. The <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn49" class="sesame">Brahmanimantanika Sutta</span> is also a very esoteric discourse, one of the most abstract in the entire Canon. According to Bhikkhu Bodhi it could be seen “as a dramatic representation of the same ideas set forth by the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn1" class="sesame">Mūlapariyāya [Sutta]</span> in abstract philosophical terms”.<sup class="sesame">44</sup> Someone other than the Buddha may well have been inspired to compose this text. Its anti-brahmanical tone also indicates it to be a piece of later propaganda. The text may have its origin in the <span data-sesame-key="sn-blurbs:sn6.4" class="sesame">Baka Sutta</span>,<sup class="sesame">45</sup> a discourse in the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:sn" class="sesame">Saṁyutta Nikāya</span> that portrays the same meeting, but with a much more standard story line.</p>
<p id="seg-77">I will let the reader decide which, if any, of these three options they prefer to reconcile the “allness of all” problem. Either way—and may this be the take-home—I think it is unwise to let questionable suttas such as this inform us on something as important as nibbāna. We’d better rely on the hundreds, if not thousands, of passages that mention the impermanence of consciousness.</p>
<h1 id="seg-78">Conclusion</h1>
<p id="seg-79">In the opening of the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span> the layman Kevaddha asks the Buddha for a superhuman miracle. The Buddha responds monks like him should not show off such things. But there is one miracle he is willing to show, the one he calls “the miracle of instruction”. Of course the Buddha did not show this miracle only in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>. The suttas contain abundant repetitions, synonyms, and definitions, which shows he always took great care to avoid possible confusion and to convey the essence of his teachings many times. As he himself said, he did not have a “closed fist”, meaning he did not keep certain teachings for certain occasions only. So when a certain passage is hard to make sense of, we should never assume that it presents something unique. Instead, we should try to interpret it in a way that fits the suttas as a whole, and this is especially the case when dealing with verse. We then follow the advice given in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn16" class="sesame">Mahaparinibbāna Sutta</span>,<sup class="sesame">46</sup> which says questionable teachings should be compared with the suttas before concluding “this is indeed the word of the Blessed One”.</p>
<p id="seg-80">Seeing <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> as a description of the state of boundless consciousness does exactly that. It results in teachings that resound throughout the discourses: the state of boundless consciousness is a state which is formless (“invisible”) and without hindrances (“fully shining”), but is nevertheless still impermanent and therefore inferior to the cessation of consciousness. And that is indeed the word of the Blessed One.</p>
<h1 id="seg-81">Addendum (2024)</h1>
<p id="seg-82">This addendum discusses two passages that shed further light on the term <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span>. It also adds some thoughts on the brahmanic concepts which the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn49" class="sesame">Brahmanimantanika Sutta</span> may be addressing.</p>
<h2 id="seg-83">Nidassana in the eight spheres of mastery</h2>
<p id="seg-84">I thought the original essay exhausted all useful contexts for determining the meaning of <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span>, but a list of meditation practices called ‘the eight spheres of mastery’ had slipped under my radar. Although not uncommon in the Pāli canon,<sup class="sesame">47</sup> these practices are unknown to most people, so a brief explanation will be necessary. Just like the nature of nibbāna, the nature of deep meditation is a topic of debate, so not everybody may agree with my interpretation. However, the exact nature of these practices is irrelevant to the general conclusion about <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-85">The eight spheres of mastery describe perceiving internal form and external form. Venerable Sujato notes: “‘Perceiving form internally’ refers to someone developing meditation based on an aspect of their own body, such as the breath or the parts of the body. The ‘forms’ seen externally are the lights or other meditation phenomena that today are usually called nimitta.”<sup class="sesame">48</sup> These nimittas are called “external forms” because to the mind’s eye they can appear just like external lights appear to the physical eye. It is even common for unexperienced meditators to believe such nimittas are burning their eyes. The spheres of mastery mention four colors of light, ordered by what was considered the least pure (blue) to the most pure (white).</p>
<p id="seg-86">The point is, these forms are described as, for instance, “forms with white color and white appearance (<span lang='pi'>ni&shy;das&shy;sa&shy;na</span>)”. Even if the reader disagrees that this describes nimittas, the term <span lang='pi'>ni&shy;das&shy;sa&shy;na</span> here indisputably refers to certain forms in the context of meditation. In my view the form that still exists in the jhānas is even more subtle than these colored lights, so the eight spheres of mastery precede not only the formless states but the jhānas too. Regardless, we can again derive that <span lang='pi'>a–ni&shy;das&shy;sana</span> in the state of boundless consciousness refers to the inability for any meditative forms to appear there (or “find a footing” there). So this too indicates that <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> is a synonym for <span lang="pi">arūpa</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-87">With this in mind, instead of ‘invisible’, a better translation for <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> might be ‘where nothing appears’ or more briefly ‘without appearance’. In hindsight I would have used such a translation throughout the essay. In a key passage we then get “the sky is without form (<span lang="pi">arūpī</span>), without appearance (<span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sano</span>)”.</p>
<h2 id="seg-88">Nibbāna as anidassana</h2>
<p id="seg-89">Another passage worth addressing attributes <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> to nibbāna.<sup class="sesame">49</sup> However, we can’t conclude that nibbāna is in all aspects equal to the boundless consciousness of the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span> simply because the same adjective is used to describe both. Nibbāna is without sensual desire, but so are the jhānas and formless attainments. Likewise, not everything that is without appearances (<span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span>) is equal to nibbāna. The sky is not nibbāna, for instance, even though it is also said to be without appearances. The passage that attributes <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> to nibbāna describes only one aspect of nibbāna, one which also happens to apply to certain other things. It indicates that nibbāna is without appearances of form, just like the empty sky, and just like the state of boundless consciousness.</p>
<p id="seg-90">But there may be a better explanation why nibbāna is called <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> in this one particular passage. It is part of a repetition series of thirty suttas, which seems to have been expanded over time, since the same series in the <span data-sesame-key="super-blurbs:sutta" class="sesame">Chinese Āgamas</span> is considerably shorter.<sup class="sesame">50</sup> These parallels also appear to contain no equivalent for <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span>, so this term is most likely a late addition to the Pāli series.</p>
<p id="seg-91">To hypothesize a reason for this, it might be that the verse of the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span> at an early time was already misunderstood to in some sense refer to nibbāna, and consequently <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> got added to the series of attributes. It would have been an easy thing to do, since all it basically required was the addition of a single word. The commentary indeed takes the verse to refer to nibbāna, although it interprets <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> not as ‘consciousness’ but as ‘to be understood’ (<span lang='pi'>viñ&shy;ñā&shy;tab&shy;ba</span>). The word never means this anywhere else, however, and the commentarial interpretation is uncompelling for other reasons as well.<sup class="sesame">51</sup></p>
<h2 id="seg-92">The Brahmanimantanika Sutta parodying Brahmanism</h2>
<p id="seg-93">In the original essay I included a “speculative note” that the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span> may be addressing brahmanical ideas on liberation. I since discovered that some statements in the earliest <span data-sesame-key="wp:Upanishads" class="sesame">Upaniṣads</span> are remarkably similar to the verses of this sutta. The <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brihadaranyaka_Upanishad" class="sesame">Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad</span> uses the exact same words “boundless consciousness” for the goal that brahmins believed to be reached when <span lang="pi">nāma</span> and <span lang="pi">rūpa</span> are discarded. This goal, the unification of the Ātman and Brahman, is also described as “neither fine nor coarse, neither long nor short”. Among other indications, this made it clear to me that the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span> and its verses are indeed addressing such brahmanic ideas in particular. I’ve written about this elsewhere before so won’t repeat myself here.<sup class="sesame">52</sup></p>
<p id="seg-94">In the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn49" class="sesame">Brahmanimantanika Sutta</span>, a text which in many aspects is similar to the Kevaddha Sutta, the situation appears to be similar. As <span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Reat 1990a">Reat</span> already pointed out: “The Buddha seems to be poking fun at [brahmanic] monism when he recounts the story of an encounter with <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span>.”<sup class="sesame">53</sup> My interpretation of <span lang="pi">viññāṇa</span> <span lang='pi'>ani&shy;das&shy;sana</span> doesn’t hinge on whether this is actually the case, but it is an interesting perspective to consider, as it can make this dense sutta a bit more relatable. <span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Reat 1990a">Reat</span> doesn’t expand, so the following are some initial thoughts on this.</p>
<p id="seg-95">The sutta starts with <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Baka Brahmā</span> saying: “This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this doesn’t get born, age, die, pass on, and get reborn again. And beyond this there is no further escape.” According to the commentary this refers to his status as a <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span>. But grammatically it can’t refer directly to himself or his realm (<span lang='pi'>brah&shy;ma&shy;lo&shy;ka</span>), because both require a masculine pronoun while <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Baka</span> uses the neuter ‘this’ (<span lang="pi">idaṃ</span>). Considering the anti-brahmanic tone of the discourse, this description may (additionally) hint at the <span data-sesame-key="wp:Ātman_(Hinduism)" class="sesame">Ātman</span>/<span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahman" class="sesame">Brahman</span>, which in the <span data-sesame-key="wp:Upanishads" class="sesame">Upaniṣads</span> is referred to in the neuter and also described with terms like ‘eternal’, ‘whole’, ‘imperishable’, and ‘unborn’. The sage <span data-sesame-key="wp:Yajnavalkya" class="sesame">Yājñavalkya</span> also describes this <span data-sesame-key="wp:Ātman_(Hinduism)" class="sesame">Ātman</span>/<span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahman" class="sesame">Brahman</span> as a boundless consciousness.<sup class="sesame">54</sup> Therefore—and since <span lang='pi'>viñ&shy;ñā&shy;naṃ</span> is also neuter—I think <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> may actually be referring to the boundless consciousness which he mentions later in the discourse (in all Pāli editions except perhaps for the broken Burmese one). He mistakes this consciousness to be permanent and so forth.</p>
<p id="seg-96">This doesn’t mean that there was a literal <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> who spoke these words in the literal state of boundless consciousness, since it’s impossible to speak there. It would instead mean that <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> is a literary device, a parody of the goal of brahmins who aimed for a permanent state of boundless consciousness, also called <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahman" class="sesame">Brahman</span>, ‘the Supreme’. In the <span data-sesame-key="wp:Upanishads" class="sesame">Upaniṣads</span> this universal <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahman" class="sesame">Brahman</span> is also anthropomorphized as a personal god who thinks and speaks, so the Brahmanimantanika Sutta would not be unique in this.</p>
<p id="seg-97">The sutta also has <span data-sesame-key="wp:Mara_(demon)" class="sesame">Māra</span> possessing a god in <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span>’s retinue in order to tell the Buddha: “Don’t attack this being! For this is <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span>, the Great Brahmā, the Vanquisher, the Unvanquished, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, God Almighty, the Maker, the Creator, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.” If this is not an allusion to <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahman" class="sesame">Brahman</span>, the source of all beings in the <span data-sesame-key="wp:Upanishads" class="sesame">Upaniṣads</span>, I do not know what it is. Compare it with the opening of the <span data-sesame-key="wp:Mundaka_Upanishad" class="sesame">Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</span>: “<span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> arose as the first among gods, as the creator of all […]. He is omniscient, he knows all.”<sup class="sesame">55</sup> <span data-sesame-key="wp:Mara_(demon)" class="sesame">Māra</span>’s description of <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> also occurs in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn1" class="sesame">Brahmajāla Sutta</span>, in what is unmistakably a parody rebuking brahmanic ideas of eternalism.<sup class="sesame">56</sup> It also occurs in the <span data-sesame-key="dn-blurbs:dn11" class="sesame">Kevaddha Sutta</span>, where <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> repeatedly avoids answering the monk’s question by replying he is the Great Brahmā and so forth. By analogy, the <span data-sesame-key="mn-blurbs:mn49" class="sesame">Brahmanimantanika Sutta</span> therefore also seems to be parodying brahmanic ideas. When “attacking” <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span>, the Buddha is actually attacking the ideal which he represents.</p>
<p id="seg-98">That the discourse addresses the ideals of others, not just that of the individual god <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span>, is indicated when <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> explains that before the Buddha’s time there were already brahmins who acknowledged the same permanent escape as him.</p>
<p id="seg-99">One may reasonably object that <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> can’t represent the brahmanic ideal of boundless consciousness because in the suttas <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> lives in the form realms, not the formless realms including boundless consciousness. Technically this may be true, but the cosmology of the early texts is also very mythological. In many ways it is just a skillful adoption of earlier Vedic concepts. I therefore think it is not impossible that <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> here is portrayed as having discovered something beyond the form realms, a boundless consciousness he thinks is permanent.</p>
<p id="seg-100">Lastly, <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> is called ‘Baka’. According to <span class="sesame" data-sesame-key="zotref:Dict-Monier-Williams">Monier-Williams</span> the word <span lang="pi">baka</span>, literally ‘crane’, also means “cheat, rogue, the crane being regarded as a bird of great cunning and deceit”.<sup class="sesame">57</sup> It is what the English-speaking world considers a fox to be. So <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)-Baka_Brahmā" class="sesame">Baka Brahmā</span> may actually be <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> the Fox. Why? Perhaps because many brahmins were deceived by the boundless consciousness they called <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahman" class="sesame">Brahman</span>.</p>
<p id="seg-101">It’s impossible to determine with certainty whether these were the exact original polemics, but that the sutta contains at least <em>some</em> refutations of Brahmanism seems beyond doubt. If anything, I hope this may prove to be a fruitful approach for future inquiry.</p>
<p id="seg-102">Be that as it may, the Buddha’s final reply to <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span>, where he mentions the cessation of existence, still portrays his highest aim. It is specifically this teaching which <span data-sesame-key="wp:Brahmā_(Buddhism)" class="sesame">Brahmā</span> praises after his eventual conversion, not boundless consciousness.</p>
